About the facts were interrogated the Lord Admiral [kapudan pasha] Sinan, some provincial governors [sanjaks] of maritime provinces who were in Istanbul & other mariners: all said they didn't know the attacker. the matter arrived to governorship of Valona, directed by Piri bey, who was reproached in a firman sent by way of a messenger [cavush] for not having denounced the culprits; he was also ordered to carry out a severe investigation. in the meantime, the sultan has given instructions to the Lord Admiral for when he'll be at sea; he must retrace t culprits, be they governors or corsairs, punish them and make compensation for the damage in way that will serve as a warning for others in the future. Venice will be fully satisfied by the justice that will be administered to it. the sultan asks that in the meantime the doge impedes any act of reprisal on part of his people against Turkish ships. 1058 transln by Girolamo Alberti Al Glorioso Principe frÌÊ li Grandi Principi Christiani Eletto frÌÊ li Magg.ri et Ecc.ti nella Religion di Chhristo, Mediatore, et orettore delli negotij dell'universa Nation Nazarena, p'ron delli habiti longhi Sig.r delli Segni della gloria, et grandezza il Dose di Ven.a il cui fine sia in bene Al gionger dell'Ecc.so Segno Imp.le saprete come il Bailo, che al p'nte resiede all'Ecc.sa Porta, hÌÊ fatto sapere come Ì¬ occorso alli 14 della luna di Saban, che ritrovandosi nel Porto di Ragosniza luoco delli Sig.ri Ven.ni una loro Galea sorta, sopra della quale vi era il Bei di Sebenico con tre suoi fig.li, et diversi gentilhuomini, che con lui andavano ad una Fiera solita farsi on' anno ÌÊ Spalato, fÌ_ assaltata da tr Galee turchesche, una con fan'Ì_ et Bandiera, et doi Fregate pur turchesche, che hostilmente la investirono di notte alla sopravista, et montativi sopra, amazzarono il Sopracomito di essa et la maggior parte di quelli che dentro vi si trovavano, gl' altri rimasti vivi insieme con il Bei di Sebenico, et li tre suoi Fig.li, furono rimurchiati via con la Galea insieme con molte some de denari, che dentro vi si trovavano con molta loro alegrezza; Onde essendo q'ste operationi in tutto contrarie alla buona promessa, hÌÊ fatto intendere, et hÌÊ ricercato che la sop.ta Galea, con l'artegliaria, et altra robba che si trovava dentro, insieme con il sop.to Bei, tre figli, et altri huomini siano restituiti, et rifatti tutti li altri danni, occorsi contra la buona pace et alli giurati Imp.l Capitoli, et oltra di ciÌ_ a far venir de quÌÂ alla Ecc.sa Porta insieme con le Galee et Fregate q'sti tali siano chi si vogliano, che hanno havuto ardire di cometter simil sceleratezze li quali debbano esser castigati, si come Ì¬ necessario; Onde essendo stato fatto copiosamente intendere q'sto negotio al Piede dell'Imp.l Sede, et il tutto compitamente inteso, et capito dalla mia Imp.l et Cesarea MaestÌÊ Ì¬ uscito mio Imp.l ordine accompagnato da felicitÌÊ, che per ogni modo siano trovati q'sti tali scelerati, et fatta inquisitione; fÌ_ procurato diligntemente et con molta solecitudine d'intendere dal Glorioso Sig.r trÌÊ gli Sig.ri gratioso il n'ro Cap.o del Mare, et n'ro Consigliero Sinan BassÌÊ, che Dio acresca le sue grandezze, et insieme da tutti li altri Sig.ri del Mare, che si trovano qui p'nti al nido dell'Ecc.sa Porta: et da alcuni altri pratici sopracomiti: Li quali tutti insieme hanno risposto non saper cosa alcuna, ne meno chi siano q'sti, che contra alla buona pace siano incorsi in simil sceleratezze, ma essendosi inteso dalla mia Cesarea MaestÌÊ, che q'sto acide'te Ì¬ occorso vicino alle marine del Sanzaccato della Valona che Ì¬ nel mio custodito Dominio Ì¬ stato scritto un honorato, et Imp.l Comand.to degno di esser honorato, et reverito dal Mondo ÌÊ Piri Bei, che si trova alla custodia di esso Sanzaccato, et strettamente co'mandatole, che conforme ÌÊ quello, che conviene all'amicitia vedi, che essendo successo tal sceleratezza vicino al suo Sanzaccato, perche non habbia procurato de intender et con diligentia non habbia fatto sapere il tutto all'Ecc.za Porta, riputandolo degno di severo castigo, perÌ_ per ogni modo che trovi q'sti, che hanno comesso tal sceleratezza contra la buona pace, overo che informatosi in diligentia avisi l'ecc.sa Porta, essendo stato eficacemente protestato, et minaciato, che usando negligentia in questo negotio sarÌÊ severamente, et al sicuro della mia Altezza castigato, et oltra che Ì¬ stato inviato in grandiss.a diligentia, et in posta per Chiaus dell'Ecc.sa Porta, huomo negotiatore, et perito il sop.to honorato comand.to Ì¬ stato anco il sop.to n'ro Cap.o ÌÊ bocca protestato, che uscendo con la Imp.l Armata in mare non debba dar riposo in alcun Modo ÌÊ q'sti, che hanno comesso sceleratezza simili, siano Sig.ri del Mare, Ì_ Capitani de Corsari, Ì_ Corsari, et chi si voglia, che alli Ven.ni cosi n'ri amici habbino contra la buona pace usato disprezzo simile, ma siano capitalmente castigati; di modo che alli altri scelerati siano di eterno esempio; acciÌ_, che non diano piÌ_ molestia non ÌÊ una Galea, ma ne anco ÌÊ una minima barca; et che insieme faci rihavere compitamente la loro galea con l'artegliaria, che vi era dentro, et ogn' altra sorte di robbe, et armizi, rifar li dan'i, et mandar sano, et salvo ÌÊ Ven.a quel Bei con li tre fig.li insieme.

Finalmente conferitici in un altra salla ampia, et spaciosa, dove dalle SS.re Governatrici fussimo incontrati, era appresso l'Ill.ma S.ra Suriana sedente la figliola vestita i habito rovano, ma ben ornata; dimostratale da lontano da me scaramelli, fÌ_ incontrata con abbracciamento dal Padre, che in quell'atto bacciandola non si pote ritenere dalle lagrime, se bene la figliola dimostrÌ_ una ciera allegra, e talmente significante la costanza, et la irrefragabilita del suo animo, che mai si mosse da quella gravitÌÊ, la quale dimostrÌ_ da principio; fÌ_ in turco interogata dal Padre, et dal Genero, se stava in quel luoco di sua voglia, et se era sforciata ÌÊ starvi, et se voleva, che haveva portato un Imperial comandamento dal Gran S.re per liberarla, et condurla al suo Paese, al che ridendo, rispose prima in Italiano, Ì_ questo nÌ_, crolando la testo; Io scaramelli vedendo, che non rispondeva in lingua, che loro intendevano, la pregai, che parlasse almeno in Schiavo, affine che rimanessero sodisfatti, quando ella rispose d'esservi libera, et di non poter esser 40v rimossa, non volendo lasciar il Cielo per la terra, et sicome ella proferi queste parole in Italiano, le quali Io Mattheacci interpretai al Padre, cosi di novo interogata da lui et dal Genero rispose in schiavo di nÌ_, stando sempre allegra, et ridente; et all'hora furono dall'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri fatti ufficij della publica buona dispositione verso di lui, et che per suo rispetto la figliola era ben trattata, ne mancorono per la bocca del Padre parole gratiose, et per gli occhi lagrime; havendo il Padre, et il Genero confessato, et affermato questo esser voler di Dio; Non mancorono all'hora il Padre, et il Genero di tentare in lingua schiava per haver dalla figliola qualhe risposta; ma essa sempre in Italiano dimostrava il suo buon animo, quando io Mattheacci interpretai le instanze del Padre, et le risposte della figliola, havendo in questi ragionamenti fattasi mentione dell'afflittione della Madre, del mancamento della sua prole, onde dicevano ella esser sola, et unica herede, et questi discorsi furono fatti tutti in piedi, havendo ella rinfacciato uno di quelli servi con parole brusche mentre voleva fraporsi nel ragionamento, et anco dimostrato d'haver in odio il Conato, che se l rendeva piÌ_ molesto del Padre, al quale replico in lingua schiava di non voler partire da quel luoco, et con dimostratione di tolleranza pareva, che s'acquietasse al suo volere, havendo co'fessato piÌ_ volte il Padre, et il Genero, che era di animo libero, et non violentato, non mancando di render gratie all'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri per l'honre, che dal publico li veniva fatto, et certo dimostrÌ_ di esser ben tranquilato. Nel voler partire, cosi il Padre, come la figliola dimandorono una Camera per sedere, et per parlare insieme che le fÌ_ concessa co' l'assistenza di Scaramelli, et Mattheacci, 41r et sedendo rinovÌ_ il Padre l'instanza alla figliola di andar seco, le racorÌ_ di esser sola, et le fece consideratione del travaglio della Madre, oltre che andando alla Casa sarebbe stata trattata da Don'a nobile, si sarebbe maritata, et haverebbe ricevuta la sua opulente heredita; parole dette in schiavo dal Padre, ella sempre in Italiano rispose di no' voler partire dalla salvezza dell'anima, d'esser qui Gentildon'a, et che se li suoi erano morti, morendo de qui sarebbero salvi, et sempre dimostrÌ_ una christiana costanza nella fede, per parole prudenti, per la voce, et per concetti molto dgni, con faccia d'inesplicabile allegrezza, et contento: Il Padre le soggionse, che almeno andasse Monaca ÌÊ Zara, ÌÊ TraÌ_, Ì_ ÌÊ Sebenico, Ì_ ÌÊ Spalato, dove le haverebbe per lo vicinato fatto qualche bene; ma essa le rispose, che era usa in questa regal CittÌÊ, da dove non voleva partire per modo alcuno, tanto piÌ_ che il Mattheacci le havevo giÌÊ promesso di farla visitare da mia Moglie, et che ero tenuto d'atenderle la promessa: In fine si licentiorono con appuntam.to di andarla visitar il Padre lunedi mattina, il che le fÌ_ promesso dall'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri et dopo novi abbracciamenti, accompagnati da lagrime si fece partenza, havendo in q'ell'atto detto ÌÊ me Mattheacci la figliola, che ella sarebbe stata dell'istesso proposito; ma che se le ascendesse una promessa; l'istessa disse alle SS.re Governatrici, ne sapendo io che promessa fusse questa, hÌ_ inteso d'andar in un Monasterio Monaca, et per me credo, che ella sia dallo spirito di Dio ben retta, et infiamata. Alla partenza il turco Padre et il Genero accompagnati fino alla Porta, resero gratie all'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri del favore non meno, che dle buon trattamento fatto alla figliola, promettendo di riferire il tutto dove bisognerÌÊ con perpetue sue obligationi, et fermato l'ordine 41v del novo congresso al lunedi mattina si licentiorono. Franc.o Scaramelli Pietro Mattheacci 5/6/1627 7/6/1627 Ser.mo Principe Hoggi, che Ì¬ alli 7 di Giugno 1627 il lunedi mattina alle hore xi non apena giunti l'Ill.mi SS.ri Polo Moresini, et Marin Querini Governatori alle cittelle, sopraven'e Acmat Aga Castellano di Clissa in barca condotto da me Franc.o Scaramelli, con Assan suo Genero , et con un turco servo, quando incontrati alla ripa da me Pietro Mattheacci intesi[?] nel primo incontro delle salutationi dalla bocca di esso Acmat AgÌÊ, che non credeva di poter venire, et se no' haveva appuntato l'ordine con detti Ill.mi SS.ri non lo haverebbe fatto, rispetto ad un accidente occorso ad un turco della sua fameglia, che Dominica il giorno precedente era stato ferrito in Merzaria, non sapeva da chi, ma che l'atto era hostile, et molto travaglioso, Io si come procurai di radolcire la sua querela co' la mala fortua dell'accidente, cosi spintomi primo nel luoco dove erano l'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri sud.i con alcune Gentildon'e, li avisai del caso, in modo che informati, potessero sopra la medesima forma di condoglienza darle risposta propria della loro prudenza, e tale, che rese il turco pricipale piÌ_ quieto, che li altri; tutto ciÌ_ incaminati alle stanze me'zate incontrata la figliola co'l solito suo modo di giovialita, et di costanza confermata, interpretando in turco io Scaramelli, rinovÌ_ il Padre l'historia del caso della ferrita, et il dubio, che haveva di non poter venire alla visita appuntata; ma rispondendo soavamente la figliola, procurÌ_ di consolarlo, tenendolo all'ufficio proprio attento, et conducendolo 42r per la mano in detti me'zadi, dove seguittando anco quelle principali Gentildon'e, furono con l'Ill.mi Gov.ri con due Confessori, et con noi Scaramelli, et Mattheacci assistenti, non mancando il Padre, che era sedente con la figliola di trattare in turco molto soavemente con essa, hora prendendola per mano, et spesso laudando il luoco, et il buon trattamento, che ad essa veniva fatto, et confessando d'esser molto sodisfatto, et obligato. Poco dopoi ella preso il Padre per la mano lo condusse in una Camera vicina, dove trovato un istrumento da sonare, fece alcuni versetti dimostrando d'haver aquistato quella virtÌ_, di che il Padre si dilettÌ_ sommamente, non meno che il Cognato ne mostrava gusto; et volendo ella parlar co'l Padre, lo condusse in un'altra Camera sola con l'assistenza di noi Scaramelli, et Mattheacci, dove no' mancÌ_ il Padre di tener seco diversi ragionamenti in turco, li quali se ben intesi da essa, furono da me Scaramelli interpretati, tutti signidicanti il gusto della sua salute, della buona custodia, delli costumi, et delle virtÌ_ acquistate indicio manifesto della religione, et pietÌÊ della Ser.ma Rep.ca non mancÌ_ egli di dire alla figliola, che haveva molte pezze de brocati, giogie, et vesture solite ÌÊ portarsi dalla Madre, a che vedendola vestita di grograno, non occorreva, che gliene facesse alcun dono, et perche egli premeva sopra la debolzza del suo vestire,et le considerava la forma delle vesti turchesche, et altri ornamenti, li quali alla sua Patria portarebbe; stimai io Mattheacci introdure in atto della dovuta riverenza l'Il.ma Cognata dell'Ill.mo et Ecc.mo S.r K.r et Prov.r Contarini, et le dissi, che sicome quella era Dam'a principalissia, et Cognata di uno dei piÌ_ Grandi SS.ri del Governo, che era stato Bailo ÌÊ Cost.li ma anco Amb.r Estraordinario al Gran Sre vicino alla 42v Ducal dignitÌÊ, havendo sostenute le principali legationi delle Regi, Imperatore, et Pontefice di ChristianitÌÊ, per ciÌ_ riguardevole al mondo; cosi essa per salvare l'anima, et per humiltÌÊ vestiva un habito di scotto, come fecevano tante altre Gentildon'e, le quali tutte di sange nobiliss.o ad altro non pensavano, che ÌÊ tralasciare ÌÊ parte le pompe mondane, per il che anco la figliola, che ad altro non pensav, che ÌÊ ben, et virtuosam.te vivere, s'haveva eletta quella forma di habito, et he se ella ne desiderava d'alcun altra sorte, perche al Padre faceva instanza, che gliene mandasse, lo faceva, come disse essa figliola per vestirsi alcuna volta in occasione di feste spirituali, di giochi, et di dimostrationi. All'hora il turco rimase sodisfattissimo, et sempre intenerito con proromper in lagrime lodando l'ottima forma di quella vita: Et perche essa figliola haveva prima conferito all'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri di voler essortar il Padre ÌÊ farsi Christano [sic], d'intorno ÌÊ che ella fÌ_ avvertita ÌÊ parlar in questo proposito con accedimento senza rendersele molesta; et Noi Scaramelli, et Mattheacci erimo vigilanti ÌÊ questo punto, non ven'e altra occasione di faticarsi i questo particolare; poiche solamente la fig.la essortÌ_ il Padre ÌÊ venir ÌÊ star ÌÊ Venetia, dove da questi Il.ri sarebbe come ella era ben veduto, et se la Madre fusse anco ella venuta sarebbe stata abbracciata; Onde il buon turco sempre stilando lagrime per gli occhi lodava la CitÌÊ, la carit, et il governo. Desiderava egli, che le rispondesse in turco, Ì_ in schiavo; al che anco io Mattheacci la persuadevo, ma in schiavo le dimandÌ_ solamente, S.r Padre, mi volete Voi bene? mi amate; ma egli inarcate le ciglia si rese quasi stupido; et poi piu volte pregÌ_ la figliola ÌÊ contentarsi che Cassan suo Genero potesse venir ÌÊ quel 43r ragionamento; il che diverse fiate le recuso, ma finalmente fece, che io Mattheacci lo chiamassi, et volendo, che io le sedesci appresso, fece seder il Conato nel luoco, che io tenevo all'incontro di essa; all'hora parendo di esser posto dal Cognato in dubio, che non sapesse ella scriver, si fece portar l'inchiostro, et la carta, et scrisse, il che aquietÌ_ il Cognato, et consolÌ_ il Padre, volendo haver un segno di tirro di pena, per ricognitione delle sue lettere, le quali promisero di mandarle vicendevolm.te spesso, massime che giornalmente s'intendevano li avisi della com'une salute, havendo dimandato il Padre alla figliola, se per le Galee di mercantia haveva ricevute alcune robbe, le quali disse esserle state rese sicure. Parve al Padre di narar in turco certa occasione di disgusto, che temeva d'haver dato alla figliola mentre era fanciulla; onde senza spettar l'interpretatione, per haver il tutto inteso, si pose ÌÊ rider, volendo significare, che per tal ocasione no' era partita. Ella disse, che sarebbe andata in un' altro luoco Monaca, ma il Padre le rispose, che stava in un Paradiso, et che non si movesse, si che le era spiaciuto solamente, che le veniva detto, che era in priggione, ma che conosceva d'esser stato igan'ato; poi che non poteva star meglio al mondo; anzi rendeva gratie ÌÊ Dio, che quel matrimonio ineguale, che haveva contratto, non habbia havuto luoco, poiche rimaneva per la sua sproportione afflitto, sicome all'incontro hora vive conoslato, et procurerÌÊ di consolare la Madre; all'hora guardando le mani, le dita, et le ungie della giovane, disse, che erano molto gentili, et piÌ_ benne di quelle della Madre, et che il buon trattamento la rendeva benna, sana, et ben governata; ne occorrendo in quelli ragionamenti osservare altri concetti famiiari, et domestici di 43v sodisfattione, di lode si tralascino, perche sarebbero tediosi, finalmente levati dal sedere si aprossimÌ_ la figliola ad un tolino, dove erano apparecchiati alcuni cristali coll'impressione del suo nome coperti de fiori in una cestella, et altre gentilezze in un' altra, d'una ben ornata don'etta vestita alla venetiana, de fiori di seta naturali ,certe scatolle di seta, un scepetto di fillo d'argento, alcuni frutti naturai, glieli presentÌ_ tutti, come opere delle sue mano, li quali mostrx aggradire, nominandola virtuosa, e tanto piÌ_ delle sue conditioni si sodisfece, quanto che poco di poi la senti ÌÊ cantare un salmo con buona voce, et con regolla musicale, et ÌÊ toccar anco un Organo, tutti effetti di sua molta miraviglia, et piena sodisfattione; Volel la fig.la andar nell' horto, dove accompagnato il Padre dall'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri dalle SS.re Governatrici, et da Noi Scaramelli, et Mattheacci, non si potesse contenere di dire, che era stato ingan'ato, et che quelli ampijssimi luochi, capaci d'ogni gran dpn'a, non erano prigioni, mÌÊ delicie incomparabili, et sempre piÌ_ con miraviglia, et lodi, vedendo l'ampiezza, et la bellezza de gli horti, si rese consolatissimo; ne Cassan suo Genero dimostrÌ_ di esser punto diverso. In quel punto mentre si procedeva alla dimostratione de detti horti, dissero ÌÊ me Mattheacci, li turchi, che han'o voluto scompetter tollari cinquecento, che io non ero Raguseo, che altro no' era, che spagnolo, et che qualch'uno mi poneva in difidenza mentre sano, che io son Venetiano, et nato ÌÊ Sebenico, et che tenevo le ragioni de turchi giÌÊ tant' an'i divanti al Ser.mo Principe ; All'hora essi turchi parlando co' lIll.mi SS.ri Gov.ri di me dissero qualche parola in mia lode, et poco di poi il Padre usÌ_ tante, e tali dimostrationi di gusto, et di sodisfatione ricevuta per le gratie fattele, nel buon trattamento 44r della figliola, et nella sua visita, che mai doverÌÊ scordarsene; non si possono riferire gli atributi alla gloria, alla giustitia, et alla caritÌÊ della Ser.ma Rep.ca. nominando li SS.ri Venetiani per signori, et Prencipi al Mondo singolari, et creda la Ser.ta V'ra, che la piÌ_ erudita lingua non haverebbe trovato forme piÌ_ proprie in tale essaltatione; Onde tendole risposto d'ordine delli Ill.mi Gov.ri da me Mattheacci ÌÊ buon proposito, non rimase che desiderare in questi ufficij, havendole massimam.te io detto, mentre mi dimandÌ_, se le figliole tenute in quel luoco erano di sangue nobile, d'haver conosciuto una della famiglia Cossazza, che Ì¬ del sangue Regio di Bossina, casa da esso benissimo conosciuta, et che erano state altre figliole nobili, delle quali l'Ill.mo S.r Querini nominÌ_ due nezze del giÌÊ Ill.mo Sr Lorenzo Bernardo, che fÌ_ due volte Bailo, et Amb.r ÌÊ Const.li e tutte insieme erano ben nate, et ottimam.te allevate, et custodite. Approssimandosi la partenza mentre la figliola faceva qualche richiesta al Padre, Ì_ di robbe, Ì_ di telle, et che egli le prometteva di consolarla, parve che si parlasse fra il Padre, et il Genero di darle danaro, et io Scaramelli sentij, che il Genero diceva, che quello, che si donava ÌÊ figlioli non si gettava via, senza venir ad altro effetto; licentiatisi, baciata la figliola, resi li debiti ringratiamenti all'Ill.mi Gov.ri montati nella barca dell'Ill.mo S.r Moresini che fÌ_ ricevuto dal buon turco ÌÊ grado con acressimento di favore partirono, se ben il Genero non mancÌ_ d'insister nella querela del ferrito, al quale io Scaramelli dissi, come le havevo detto prima, che ÌÊ me in Cons.li era stata data una ferita da u imbriaco, et che per ciÌ_ non potevo lamentarmi d'alcuno, poiche ero solo, ma che se sarÌÊ trovato il delinque'te, conforme ÌÊ quanto le era stato dettot dal'Ill.mi SS.ri Gov.ri sarebbe stato severam.te castigato. Franc.o Scaramelli Petro Mattheazzi Adi 11 Giugno L. R.s 44v 6/11/1627 Venuto nell'Ecc.mo Coll.o Acmat AgÌÊ Castellano di Clissa, cosi interpretando il fid.mo Franc.o Scaramelli Dragomano, disse. Ser.mo Principe, son venuto ÌÊ licentiarmi da V. S[er].tÌÊ et ÌÊ renderle gratie dei favori, et delli honori, che si Ì¬ compiacciuta farmi, et sicome conosco di non poter sodisfar in alcuna parte ÌÊ questo debito, cosi ne prometto ÌÊ V. Ser.tÌÊ perpetua obligatione; HÌ_ veduto mia figliola in stato assai diverso da quello, che mi Ì¬ stato rappresentato, bella, sana, et virtuosa, custodita da principalissime Gentildon'e, in luogo molto ampio, et spacioso, diversamente da quello, che io credeva, diche ne ringratio Dio, et non mancarÌ_ in ogni luogo di essaltar la Ser.tÌÊ V'ra de buona giustitiÌÊ, de bontÌÊ, de integritÌÊ, et della protettione, che tiene della p.ta mia figliola, la quale io gli racomando con tutto il cuore. Rispose sua Ser.t che sentiva som'o contento delle sue sodisfattioni, che sempre haveva protetto essa sua figliola, che lo farÌÊ anco nell'avvenire, et li pregava dal S.r Dio felice, et salvo ritorno alla Patria; RicercÌ_ poi la risposta alla lettera del suo Imperatore, che hÌÊ presentato ÌÊ Sua Ser.tÌÊ li fÌ_ detto, che si haveriano dati gli ordini bastevoli al Bailo, et no' esser solito di darli dalla Rep.ca l're ad alcun particolare: RicercÌ_ anco, che havendo comprate alcune robbe per la sua fameglia, fosse contentata sua Ser.tÌÊ farli alcuna agevolezza nei Datij, li fÌ_ risposto, che ne lasciasse la nota, che si pensaria ÌÊ darli alcuna sodisfattione, co' che licentiato partÌÂ. 6/11/1627 in Pregadi Havendo con determinata risolutione della sua libera volontÌÊ, abbracciata la legge Christiana la figliola di Acmat AgÌÊ Castellano di Clissa, custodita nel luoco delle Cittelle alla Giudeca, con particolar ispiratione del S.r Dio, come chiaramente si Ì¬ 45r conosciuto nella istessa CittÌÊ di Spalato, dove hÌÊ ricercato il sacro del Battesimo, et con la relatione dell'abbocamento fatto co'l Padre nel medesimo luogo delle Cittelle, sodisfacendo alla bontÌÊ della sua conscienza Ì¬ stata constantissima, non ostante che la invitasse il Padre ÌÊ ritornare ÌÊ casa, con promesse di gran fortune per persuaderla incontrario, restando ella nondimeno sempre piÌ_ ferma nel suo buon proposito, con particolar inclinatione di ridursi Monaca in qualche Monasterio di questa CittÌÊ, Ì_ Contrade, Ì¬Ì¬ conveniente alla pietÌÊ della Sig.ria N'ra ad honore del S.r Dio, che tanto hÌÊ favorito q'sta creatura con le sue gratie darli com'oditÌÊ per effettuare ccosi lodevole, et santa vocatione: Et perche anco s'intende, che quando lei sapesse di poter senza aggravio della Casa rimanere nelle Cittelle, resteria parimente consolata di quella honestissima habitatione; poiche pare alla sua discretezza di pregiudicare grand.te alla povertÌÊ del luogo co'l fermarsi lungamente in esso, senza qualche dovuto riconoscimento. PerÌ_ L'anderÌÊ parte, che quando persisti nel pensiero di andar Monaca sia com'esso con l'autt'a di questo Cons.o ai Prov.ri sopra i Monasterij di trattare co'l mezo di Mons.r R.mo PAtriarca di questa CittÌÊ, overo di Mons.r R.mo Vescovo di Torcello con le principali di quei Monasterij, dove ella inclinasse di omnacare, persuadendole ÌÊ riceverla nella loro Religione con quella elemosina, Ì_ dote, che possa esser ragionevole, che dovera esserli proveduta dei danari della Sig.ria N'ra a questo medeimo Cons.o con darli anco com'oditÌÊ di metter modestam.te in ordine la sua cela, et da potersi sovenire alla giornata; poiche ella non puÌ_ da altra parte aspettare, ne ricevere alcun suffragio, non dovendo perÌ_ esser firmata alcuna cosa da essi Proveditori ma debbano portar il tutto in scrittura nel Collegio n'ro, p[er]che con la previa consulta dei savij si dovenga da questo medesimo 45v Cons.o ÌÊ quella risolutione, che sarÌÊ giudicata ad honore di sua Divina M'tÌÊ conveniente, et necessaria. Ma quando si contentasse di fermarsi nella Casa delle Cittelle; accioche possa con l'animo quieto continuar ÌÊ servire il S.r Dio, nel medesimo luogo, li siano assignati ducati sessanta all'an'o da esserli di tempo in tempo mentre viverÌÊ questa giovane, et si fermata nella Casa corisposti ÌÊ quei Gov.ri, et Governatrici per il viver, et mantenimento di essa, da esserli pagati intieramente delli danari della Sig.ria N'ra dalli Camerlenghi di Com'un, con li mandati del Collegio nostro, segondo l'rodinario.

Questo Ecc.mi SS.ri sono li otto Dragomani, che sevono in Const.li con tutti li Salarij espressi, che godono. Hora diremo in nostro river.mo senso della necessitÌÊ, che si possi havere di tanti Drag.ni ÌÊ quella Corte, & se siano Ì_ nÌ_ superflui in quel Ministerio. PuÌ_ esser che nei tempi andati fosse piÌ_ ristretto quel numero, Ì_ collocato almeno in soggetti di q'sta Cittadinanza, Ì_ sudditi; Ma certo Ì¬, et il fatto per se stesso lo dimostra, che tutti otto possono in aso di gravissimi negotij esser necesarij, & adoperati da gl'Ecc.mi Baili: Come parim.te puÌ_ essere, che alcune volte si possa far con quattro soli, secondo la qualiÌÊ de tempi, e de gl'emergenti, che nascono: SÌ_ q'sto di certo io Foscarini, che nel tempo del mio Baillagio, per qualche rilevante affare mi son valso di tutti, in attioni diverse, et multiplici: Et io Contarini, nel neg.o de Corsari c'ha durato q'nto l'EE VV san'o, molto mi son valso di tutti essi, ÌÊ segno, che niente soverchio m'era il loro numero i per la diversitÌÊ de gl'impieghi, che occorrevano; per l'espedni fatte in diversi luoghi da Terra, &da Mare; per prender lingua, & attender ÌÊ gl' andamenti dell'Arsenale; per andar tall'hora co'l Grillo, & coadiuarlo; Et alcun' altro ad altre incombenze del Baillaggio spinosiss.o per quel solo iportant.mo negotio: Fatioso oltre modo riesce il Ministerio de Dragomani per il continuo moto in che star devono dalla mattina alla sera, essendo turchi solleciti molto nelle cose loro, si che il Dragomano tal volta non ha tempo di respirare, convenendo portarsi sÌ_, et giÌ_ per quelle Colline, onde quando passano certa etÌÊ, possono, come suol dirsi, metter l'Armi al tempio, quando non habbino buona, & forte natura per agitare, come tiene il presente Dragoman Grillo, tutto che camini al sessagesimo anno; Che perÌ_, e per aiutarlo, e per instruirsi sariÌÊ bene ch'uno dei giovani l'accompagnasse q'do vÌÊ alle Porte dei BassÌÊ ÌÊ negociare. Dragomano espresso certam.te richiede l'affare de Mercanti, espedne di Navi, litti, et altro, ÌÊ segno, che q'ndo anche vi sono piÌ_ n're Bavi ÌÊ Const.li un solo non basta. Lo scrivere, tradurre, &altr fontioni pur ne tengono applicato uno: Et piÌ_ d'uno il condurre, & ricondurre gl'Ecc.mi Baili, oltre quelli che per qualche neg.o si trovano absenti, Ì_ per indispositione amalati: Si che disposti li soggetti ÌÊ ttte q'ste becess.e fontioni il numero sod.o di otto, niente soverchio resce, havuto massime riguardo cosÌÂ alla Peste, che frequente in quei Paesi, potra in poche hore rapirne piÌ_ d'uno, come ano all'impiego, he si potria dare (e river.te lo raccordiamo) ad alcuno di essi ÌÊ Cattaro, ove per la piÌ_ stretta vicinanza de Confini dello Stato Veneto con l'Imp.o Ottomano, piÌ_ frequentei etiandio nascono li disturbi, e le brighe, nelle quali la presenza s.a il fatto d'un Drag.no (poiche il Pace ha molto, che fare nel rimanente di quelle Prov.e Ì¬ aggravato tal volta da molte indispos.ni) et lasia[?] di gran vantaggi alle cose publiche, per lo scrivere, tradurre, andar in Paese, trattar con Turchi gl'aggiustam.ti, p.ma, che li reclami dei med.mi, che s'avantaggiono con le p.me impressioni vadano alla Porta per osservare, e far tutt'altro, che occorresse: Alli quali Confini di Cattaro hÌ_ io Cont.ni nel mio venire in Patria convenuto lasciar il Giovine della lingua Pace, condotto meco con licenza dell'Ecc.mo Sen.o quale anco intendo, ÌÊ misura di suoi talenti, & etÌÊ, essersi portato bene; Et Ì¬ di p'nte in Provincia per supplicar V'ra Ser del solito accrescim.to, et ritornar ÌÊ Const.li ÌÊ perfettionar li suoi studij. Q'sto med.mo Dragomano ÌÊ Cattaro potria condursi tal volta s.a l'Armata di V. Ser. anzi appresso la persona dell'Ill.mo Prov.r di essa, perche essendo gl'accidenti del Mare molto rilevanti, et che piÌ_ frequenti per aventura portano li disturbi ÌÊ Const.li, et dano da travagliare ai Baili, oltre l'esped.ne ch'espressa talhora potria farsi ai Baili med.mi con rap'ntar le cose, che accadono, serviria il condursi all'Armata d'un drag.no per far Cozetti, et altre scritt.e con le formule necess.e, che da se sole portano alla Corte gran vantaggio p[er] la buona condotta de gl'affari, e sono l'armi, che piÌ_ s'adoprano, & vagliono con Turchi; da che seguirebbe, che di raro saria all'oscuro il Bailo de fatti, saria preavertito dell'instanze, e pretentioni, e quel che piÌ_ importa munito di scritture proprie per diffendersi, mancam.to i hoggidÌÂ bene spesso segue in quasi tutti li Negocij de Confini, &di Mare. Ne certam.te con minore publico serv.o saria l'assistenza quÌÂ al Mag.to Ill.mo dei cinque Savij d'un Drag.no partic.re per li cosÌÂ gravi multiplici negocij del Levante, che s'agitano ÌÊ quel Mag.to E q'sti tutti soggetti potriano cavarsi dal Corpo dei Drag.ni overo dei migliori Giovani di Lingua, che s'andassero allevando ÌÊ Const.li, quali serviriano con lo stesso stipendio senz' aggravio del pub.co Errario, e di tanto s'avantaggiarebbe il serv.o di V Ser. e dell' EE VV, perche il nego Ì¬ quello, che fÌÊ gl' huomeni, l'otio li distrugge: Saria q'sto di molto aiuto anc.oa al S.r Seg.rio Scaramelli ÌÊ cui restaria il maneggio dei negocij piÌ_ importanti, delle scritture, co'l Posto et decoro parim.te del Drag.to maggiore, congionto ÌÊ quello di Seg.rio dell'EE VV il qual Scaramelli, se per accidente di malatie, Ì_ d'altro non potesse assister ÌÊ qualche necess.o impiego, anco il serv.o pubco resteria disavantaggiato per non eservi altri soggetti. Con tale, et seconod il n'ro riverente senso, neessaria distributione, niente supperfluo veniria ad esser il n.ro de gl'otto Drag.ni, che giÌÊ vi sono, e di qulach'altro ancora, che li potesse aggiongervi, nÌ¬ quali tutti sono talenti, & conditioni molto proprie per il bisogno, ne bisogna per modo alcuno disfarsene, perche subito sariano presi ÌÊ serv.o di Francia, & Ing.ra; quali invidiamo in q'sta parte la felicitÌÊ dei Baili, perche d'Hebrei, & d'altra simil gentraglia sevir si convenono . Quanto poi alli Giovani della lingua sono q'sti tredici in tutto. Il p.mo Ì¬ il Vecchia : et q'sto ha ducati sessanta all'anno, co due Vesti di p.ma condotta; Et in oltre conto vinti ducati annui d'accrescim.to, con sei cechini di buona mano, essendo il piÌ_ vecchio di quell'ordine, che serva, com'ho io Contarini espresso nelle risposte d'ord.e di VV EE alla richiesta c'ha fatto per esser Drag.no, alle quali si rimettemo anco per l'espressioni di sua attitudine, et ocnditioni per il servitio . V'Ì¬ poi Gabriel Agapito, fig.lo del Medico, oriondo di Cipro , et ha apunto quanto il Vecchia, etia' li cento vinti ducati all'anno d'accrescim.to, concedutigli dall'Ecc.mo Sen.o q'ndo venne ad accompagnar l'ultimo Chiaus p[er] l'assontione dell'Impr Regnante. Come parim.te Ruggiero Tarsia fratello del Drag.no c'ha q'nto li so.di due. Marco Pace fig.lo del Drag.no di Dalm.a ha la sola p.ma condotta, che sono ducati sessanta all'anno, sei Cechini di Regalia, con due vesti sez' altro accrescimento per il quale, com'Ì¬ predo doveva presto supplicare. Lo stesso ha in tutto, e per tutto Giovanni Piron, nativo di Pera, e fra li Gentilhuomeni di Rito lattino, che sono in quel luoco, benche di p'nte il di lui Padre caduto in povertÌÊ di molti debiti aggravato li ritrovi . Pietro Fortis pur nativo di Pera, ma di Padre Anconitano . Marco Tarsia fratello minore del Drag.no Pietro Borisi, della Casa benemerita, nota al'EE VV ma che dimora alla sua Patria di Capo d'Istria per publica permissione in assai opulenti fortune : Q'sti tre godono il solo p.mo stipendio, & Regalie soprad.e senz' accrescimento alcuno Ambrosio Grillo figliolo del Drag.n Grande. Dominico Sanguinazzo di Padre Ven.no il cui fratello serve Drag.no in Aleppo. Christoforo Brutti, fig.lo di pochi anni, il cui Padre fÌ_ Dragno benemerito, de piÌ_ avanzati, & mancato in publico servitio. Carlo Balsarini figliolo del Console di Scio. Et Michiel Parada . Anche q'sti cinque hanno il solo p.mo stipendio di duati sessanta, sei echini di buona mano, & due Vesti all'anno. Questi Ser.mo P'npe Ecc.mi SS.ri sono li tredici attuali Giovani della lingua frÌÊ sudditi, & non sudditi, che studiano di p'nte ÌÊ Const.li, alcuni di buona attitudine, et con molto avanzata cognitione della lingua per tutte le fontioni; Altri in riguardo dell'etÌÊ Ì_ di capacitÌÊ minore, con anche minor profitto. Di questi n'ro river.mo senso sarebbe, che come di presente non fosse bene scemare il numero, Ì_ far riforma alcua, per non lasciar cadere il solito stile della publica fede, & caritÌÊ, la quale nelle riforme med.me con soavitÌÊ mista co'l proprio vantaggio Ì¬ solita sempre decretare, de estero, q'ndo l'abuso non porti notabile, & grave il pregiudicio nella dilatione, perche in effetto il dono delle lingue, piÌ_ dalla natura, & da una gratia partic.re che dallo studio proviene; CosÌÂ bisogna considerare, che questi Giovani di lingua sono per lo piÌ_ figlioli di Dragomani morti, Ì_ di quelli, che sono in attual servitio; Altri sono figlioli di Consolo, Ì_ d'altri ser.ri pur della Rep.ca ÌÊ quali tutti per ricompensa dei servitij, che rendono in un Paese soggetto ÌÊ pericoli di vita, non si puÌ_ certo, ne per publica munificenza, ne per ragion di buon governo, ne per capo d'essempio in altri, dar ricompensa minore, quannto l'admetter uno dei loro figlioli nello studio dlle lingue, mediante il quale possono ache habilitarsi ÌÊ servire il publico, e liberarli insieme da quel pericolo, che il Paese Turchesco seco med.mo necessariam.te porta: Altri sono figlioli di quei Peroti ben affetti, nella cui affettione ha stimato la Rep.ca concorrervi il serv.o publico non solo, ma divertirli insieme dall'obligarsi alle Cose di Francia, et Inghiltera, che ben spesso li vano ricercando; Altri finalmente sono dei mandati espressam.te da Venetia per introdursi nella cognitione della lingua ÌÊ necess.o contropunto dei Nativi del Paese, per allevar soggetti, he co'l tempo nella Cancellaria, nel Dragomanato maggiore di q'sta CittÌÊ, nel magistrato alla Mercantia, nelle accorrenze di Dalmatia, & dell'Armata, come di sopra habbiamo river.te raccordato, supplir potessero, mentre in tutti tali impieghi non saria peraventura bene, impiegar soggetti naturalm.te sudditi del Turco, i quali poi per qualche accidente disgustati, ritorassero informati de gl'interessi piÌ_ reconditi della Rep.ca Diressimo dunque, che come per quest' ultimo riflesso saria molto ÌÊ proposito il continuar di quando in quando l'esped.ne di qualche d'uno dei nostri per imparar le lingue ÌÊ Const.li secondo li decreti antichi dei n'ri maggiori, co' quali resta dichiarito, non potersi ellegger Dragoman Grande, che non sia Cittadino Venetano, che cosÌÂ anco non si possi per Grandwezza, & servitio publico, rifiutar li figlioli dei Dragomani, & altri Ì_ morti in servitio, Ì_ servitori attuali, per giusta retributione del merito loro, & per essempio d'altri ancora: Ma perche non Ì¬ di dovere, che tutti q'sti benche giusti pretesti, debbano condur il numero di essi Giovani all'eccesso, crederessimo fosse bene stabilirlo una volta per sempre nel numero prefisso di otto Ì_ dieci almeno, perche in tal numero prefisso nessuno potrebbe disgustarsi di restar escluso, quando non vi fossero Vacanze di luoo, e nell' occasioni delle vacane med.me molti sariano i concorrenti, tra quali si potriano sempre scieglier quelli, he fossero di maggior attitudine, Ì_ aspettatione, overo di Casa magg.te benemerita; Et per dar nel med.mo tempo stimolo ÌÊ quelli, che fossero inclusi, n'ro river.te senso sarebbe, che in ogni mutatione di Bailaggio si essaminasse nel legger, e scriver, cosÌÂ Turco, come Italiano; Et Italiano dicemo, perche li Nativi del Paese, sicome tutti parlano naturalm.te Greco, cosÌÂ apprendono ancora piÌ_ facilm.te il turco, & Persiano, chel' Italiano, Ì_'l Latino: Et, che tutto questo seguisse alla presenza de gl'Ecc.mi Baili Vecchio, e Novo, e di quegl' altri prattici, che ÌÊ loro Ecc.ze paressero: Quelli, che veram.te non facesser profitto, con donativo d'una, Ì_ due Vesti, Ì_ di denaro equivalente, licentiarli, & in luoco loro am'etter altri delle cond.ni di sopra espresse, l'elettione de quali dipendesse dall'EE VV sopra informationi giurate de Baili uniti, Ì_ separati: Quelli ancora, che conosciuto fosse haver fatto profitto, si potriano non solo rittenere, ma per magg.te animarli, assignar loro qualche augumento di provisioe, parca, e frequente, ma non in altro tempo, che dle detto general essame, et sopra informatoni d'ambi li Baili, e questo per lavar il tedio all'Ecc.mo Senato, non meno, che alli Baili med.mi delle perpetue loro instanze senza perÌ_ legar la mano alla publica munificenza di poter in qualche estraordinario caso, riconoscer anche estraordiariamente qualche d'uno, che se ne rendesse meritevole: E perche hanno grand.te bisogno li Giovani di lingua, massime quelli del Paese, d'apprender bene il parlar Italiano, co'l quale poi piÌ_ facilmente si perfettionano nel turco, essendo, che il Coza, per altro valoroso nell'Idioma turco, Persiano, & Arabo, niente intende il Franco, e cosÌÂ non sapendo ne'l uno, ne'l altro la forza dei vocaboli, et il vero loro significato, vengono li giovani ÌÊ perder li due Ì_ tre primi anni dei loro studij, Ì_ li passano con poco profitto: Raccordiamo con ogni riverenza, per com'am.te necess.o, il proveder essi Giovani di soggetto, che gl'instruisca nella lingua Italiana, et gl'inegni anco ÌÊ scriver con buona frase, & carattere, che molto importa per le traduttioni di lettere, et altre scritture, che si mandano da Ven.a, et ?oda gl'Ecc.mi Baili si scrivono: Questo soggetto potria essere Ì_ il Capellano dell'attuale Ecc.mo Bailo, con qualche augumento di salario, Ì_ alcuno dei Padri Franciscani, Ì_ dominicani, che si mndano ÌÊ Const.li, che come sudditi godono ando certo annuo den.o, che gli paga il Cottimo di V'ra Ser.; Et potria in tal caso nell'esped.ni ricercar li superiori, che ÌÊ q'sto effetto ne mandassero alcuo versato partic.te i belle lettere, & nelle piÌ_ proprie cond.ni per tal ministerio: Per ultimo ÌÊ discarico ben grande di n'ra conscienza diremo: Che q'sto Ì¬ un negocio damaneggiarsi con molta delicatezza, perche un giovine della lingua, a molto piÌ_ un Dagomano, che disgustato partisse dalla Casa dei aili, ma informato altretanto de gl'interessi, & negocij, che corrono, potriano cagionar disturbi grandi, anzi grandmi, onde q'sta rifroma se pur si deve fare, non crederessimo fosse espediente parimano[?] senon con le forme sepmre pratticate dalla Rep.ca p[er] l'avenire, Ì_ sia de cetero, come di V.a habbiamo espresso.

Questo hÌÊ fig.li di poca etÌÊ, che mostrano buon talento.

And.a Bon Ì¬ pur huomo che intende, legge, e traduce bene, et Ì¬ studioso; questo sarebbe attissimo per essercitar il carico di dragomano da stradda come fÌÊ il Salvago; hÌÊ servito l'Ecc.mo S.

Il Settimo,et ultimo Ì¬ Pasqua Naone giovanetto di poca etÌÊ, eletto p[e]r gratia in loco del P're benemerito mancato di vita, et era drag.n Prottogero; p[er] la sua etÌÊ incapace le Ì¬ stato dato p[e]r sostituto Georgio Giracchi con promessa di dragomano, quando il Naon sia in stato di essercitar la carica, alla quale non credo che habbi molta attitudine , come il suo sostituto sarebbe attissimo, mÌÊ l'esser vecchio, et poco sano, ben spesso le fÌÊ desiderare di subintrar al Dragomanato promessole, offerendosi perÌ_ di accitare il Naon in ogni occorrenza et ÌÊ me pare che ne tenga ragione. Questi sono tutti li Dragomani che hora servono la SertÌÊ V'ra Della veritÌÊ di ciÌ_ ch'io le scrivo luntanissimo da qual si sia affetto, credo che ne haveranno la confirmat.ne da questiss.ri Ecc.mi he piÌ_ lungam.te di me li hanno maneggiati. PiÌ_ vi sarÌÊ da dir di questi giovini della lingua, li quali sono in n.ro di tredici, delli quali due non sono al p'nte qui; Il Borisi fig.lo che fÌ_ del Dragoman Grande, che di molto tempo se ne stÌÊ in Capo di Istria sua patria , con pub.a permissione, et p[er] benigna concessione dell'Ecc.mo Senato gode il Salario e regalie come se fosse presente in riguardo delli meriti di suo P're, et forse che non penserÌÊ piÌ_ al tornarsene in queste parti.

Delli altri undeci, Vi Ì¬ Paulo Vecchia Venetiano che giÌÊ quattordeci anni hÌÊ preso questo impiego. Questo legge, scrive, e parla bene il Turco, et spera la gratia d'esser eletto dragomano senza di che, come hÌ_ gi scritto, non sÌ_ se si contenterÌÊ di fermarsi piÌ_ ÌÊ lungo, nel med.o posto. Questo Ì¬ perÌ_ cosi debole di complessione, et vive con tutta la riserva mag.re come se fosse fabricitante, ne vedo in lui alcun' avanzo di salute, onde poco fondam.to credo che si possa fare di sua p[er]sona . L'altri Sono Aggapito Balsarini , doi Tarsia Rugger, e Marco , Grillo fig.lo del Drag.n Grande , Sanguinazzo , Perada , Fortis , Piron , et Brutti questo si puÌ_ dire fanciullo di P're benemerito, et mostra assai buon talento.

Ill.ma battegiare, et rivocoveratosi nella Casa de Turchi, da quali intendeva che veniva egli protteto et spaveggiato, volessimo procurare perla sopraitendenza che tiene il mag.to n'ro ÌÊ quel loro, che gli fosse detto moro restituito: Per il che di subito dassimo ordine al sec.rio n'ro, che con un fante, et qualche sensaro della lingua si conducesie al d.o loco dei Turchi per procurare di havere il sud.o moro: et che quanto non gli lo volessero dare, dovesse farli sapere, che tali violenze no piacevano al mag.to; Che non gli sariano permesse; et che si saria preso quell'ispediente, che fosse parso migliore alla giustitia. Per esecutione del qual n'ro ordine essendosi egli sec.rio condotto alla suda habitatione de Turchi. Ci riferisse haver operato quel piÌ_ le Ì¬ stato possibile con dolci parole p[er] haver il moro, et poi p[er] render capaci li medmi Turchi del mal loro termine, et violenza che usavano; Che p.ma negavano di haver il moro: ma rimproverati, dissero poi, che se vi era, vi stava con sua voluntÌÊ; Che se pur era vero che fosse 1v Christiano, era stato ingannato, et gli era stata fatta violenza; et finalmente, che non intendevano di darlo. Ma repplicando il Sec.rio che quando havesse rifferto al mag.to n'ro questa loro pertinatia, et mal trattare, invece di haver da noi quella prottet.ne de loro interessi che hanno sempre havuto, si saria passato ÌÊ qualche delibera.ne che non gli sarebbe piacciuta, onde scesero[?] ÌÊ promettergli, che la mattina seguente haverebbero essi obbedito, et condotto al mag.to il moro, perche quando havesse lui detto di voler esser Christiano, fosse et quando nÌ_, non credevano che p[e]r forze si volesse che fosse Christiano. Cosi la mattina di hieri pma di venire al mag.to Cso si riducessimo al magistrato, et mentre stavinmo attendendo, che eseguissero quanto era stato appuntato, et conducessero il moro al mag.to n'ro, sono comparsi in gran n.ro li turchi senza di esso, fingendo non sapere quello che si volesse: di che rimpronerati da noi le commettessimo che dovessero andar immediate ÌÊ levare il d.o moro, et condurlo avanti di noi, che si saressimo novam.te riddotti p[e]r questo effetto; et acciÌ_p[er] qualche tema che potessero havere, fosse magg.te assicuralo, commettessimo ad uno de n'ri fanti, che lo dovesse accompagnare; 2 col quale partiti, invece di capitare al mag.to n'ro, et all'obbedienza di esso, tumultuariam.te lo condussero alle Porte dell'ecc.mo Coll.o di dove (mossi da morti[?] loro pensieri) lo ricondussero ÌÊ Casa: il che inteso da noi giudicassimo di n'ro debito il portar il tutto di subito ÌÊ gl'ecc.mi s.ri savij stimandolo negotio di q'llo consequenze, che la prudenza di re S.tÌÊ et di VV ecc.e possono comprender, et ricever p[er] il di piÌ_ quello havesse parso ÌÊ loro ecc.e di commetterci et p[er]che fÌ_ creduto bene di vedere, se col novam.te mandare alla casa de Turchi, prenderli magg.i capaci del loro mancam.to fosse stato possibile di haver esso moro, fÌ_ da noi, p[er] l'absenza, et indispositne del scaramelli dragomano, dato ordine al sigr m' Ant.o Velutelli, come prattico i negotij de turchi , che intraprendesse questo affare, et unitam.te con Anzolo Tirandi Sansaro , per interprete della lingua , operasse quel piÌ_ che con la destrezza sua le fosse possibile p[e]r haver nelle mani il moro, et condurlo ÌÊ noi. Cosi partito il Velutilli col sudo Tirandi p[er] eseguire quanto di sopra, e hÌÊ poi rifferto, che havendo applicato ogni spirito i questo affare, non Ì¬ stato possibile riddur la p[er]tenatia[?] de turchi al dovere; che sebene alcuno di quelli mercanti che contsreva[?] di piÌ_ garbo[?], p[er] le sue p[er]suasioni si contentava di consignarli il d.to moro: ad ogni modo la moltitudine degl'altri streppitosam.te rispondava, che piÌ_tosto che darlo, l'haverebbero tagliato in quattro pezzi. ÌÛ che repplicando il Velutilli, et il sensaro, che questi non erano termini da buoni mercanti, che non dovevano mostrarsi cosi disubbidenti ad un mag.to che tiene la prottet.ne di loro interessi, al quale dovevano pure ubbidirre ogni volta che cad.o, e tutti essi ancora fossero ad esso chiamati, Risposero pertinarem.te di non voler darlo, mÌÊ che sarebbero venuti un' altro giorno che fosse ordinario di riddut.ne; p[er]che se solam.te doppo queste mese, et anno si viene all'ispeditione di alcuno di loro negotij, si poteva bene haver da noi patienza due, et tre giorni, ne haver tanti fretta: aggiungendo di piÌ_ o parole arroganti, et impertinenti, pregiuditieli alla dignitÌÊ della carica, che se noi volevimo alcuna cosa da loro, dovessimo transferirsi alla loro casa, et habitatione Ne restando il Velutilli di adoperarsi con ogni spirito in questo neg.o, si fece condur avanti di lui il moro p[er] sapere qualche part.e della sua intentione, et p[er]che causa fosse fuggito dal suo p'rone, et p[er] assicurarlo finalm.to che non haverebbe ricevuto alcuna dispiacere quando si fosse fatto condurre avanti di noi: Questo non rispondeva 3 altro ?non Monsulman, Monsulmano, levando all'uso de turchi, la meno, senza dir altra parola: ne giovando al Velutelli le dolci parole, ne le ammonit.ni. et qualche minaccia, convenne partire senza riportar altro frutto delle sue operat.ni, che parole impertinenti da essi turchi, che si lasciano anco intenderre, che si lascieriano piÌ_ tosto tagliar ÌÊ pezzi, che dar il moro.

Hora doppo gionto il predetto Sanzaco ÌÊ Venetia, fece capo col Ressidente di Fiorenza, il qualetolendo copia della soprascritta lettera della Gran Duchessa, et facendosi anco dare il mandato della Porta scritto in Turco, scrisse ÌÊ Fiorenza dando conto dell' arrivo di detto Sanzaco ÌÊ Venetia, et che volendo S. A. che egli si transferisca in quella cittÌÊ, restasse servita di mandargli il passaporto; ma havendo egli da passar anco per il paese di sua Sanc.ÌÊ non voleva mettersi in camino, se no' havea anco un passaporto espresso dal Papa, fatto in buona forma, per non incorrer in qualche pericolo nel viaggio. Et quÌÂ m'addusse esso Sanzaco l'essempio di fra Fuglientio, che essendo stato affidato di andar ÌÊ Roma, era poi stato abbuggiato dubitando quasi, che essendo stato fratte ancor lui come si dice, non gli intravenisse il medesimo. FÌ_ 12 risposto il spaccio passato al Ressidente, per nome del Gran Duca, che prima, che esso Sanzaco vadi ÌÊ Fiorenza, conferisca co' lui tutto quello vuole proponer, e trattar, et dando poi egli conto ÌÊ S. A. di ogni cosa si prenderÌÊ risolutione per la sua andata: Della qual risposta essendo restato molto disgustato detto Sanzaco, rispose al Ressidente, che egli no' hÌÊ com'issione, et ordine di trattar, et negociar con altri, che co'l Gran Duca; perche prima la reputatione del suo Imperator non lo comportava, et per seconda no' puo egli preterire in alcun modo le sue com'issioni, et ordini; il che inteso dal Ressidente, hÌÊ preso tempo di tornar ÌÊ scriver ÌÊ Fiorenza, et s'aspetta lo spaccio venturo la rispsota. In tanto havendo io adimandato al Sanzaco, che opinione, et pensiero hÌÊ il Ressidente di questo negocio, mi hÌÊ risposto, che lo hÌÊ per negocio grave, et difficile, per diversi rispetti: Et se bene il Gran duca haveria forse maggior utile dalla negociatione, e traffico, che fosse introdotto nel Levante, per dar essito alli suoi pan'i di seta, et di lana, et altre sue merci; che dalla navigatione delli suoi Vasselli, mantenuti co' gran spesa, et interesse; non dimeno il Re di Spagna, et la Religion di S. Steffano, dubita, che no' comporteran'o l'admissione de gli ultimi doi Capitoli, troppo pregiudiciali all' uno, et all' altra: Et il Sanzaco dice, che senza di quelli no' si farÌÊ niente; perche i Turchi han'o piÌ_ mira ÌÊ questo, che al resto. Dall' altra banda poi essendo stato mutato anco il Primo Visir, et dismesso il BassÌÊ, et il Defterdar della Bosina, che s'haveano affettionato ÌÊ questo negocio, dubita il med.o Sanzaco, per quello, che io vedo, et comprendo, che 12v non si facci nulla; et perÌ_ vorebbe egli co'l mostrarsi confidente, come huomo accorto, et sagace, insinuarsi nella gratia di V.

Qualche giorno prima che fosse asaltata la Casa della Ser.ma Rep.ca in Pera io mi trovavo qui in Casa del Piron Orefice mio amico molto intrinsico, che mi confida tutte le cose sue per gl'interessi che passano insieme; All'hora si trovava anco qui il Dragoman suo fratello d'ordne del s.r Ambasc,r d'Inghiltera per dar doi mille Reali al Caimecan a conto di certi commandam.ti, che li diede per Barbaria Questo Dragomano in discorso mangiando noi una sera tutti tre insieme disse, che nella sopradeta asa di Venetia si trovava due figure humane di Tella; mÌÊ che bisognava tacere.

Un giorno, che fui mandato da Sua Ecc.za dal CapichiagiÌÊ del Caimecan di Cost.li , che sÌÊ tutti li suoi secreti, et si scrive ogni partic.re puÌ_ esser un Mese in circa, che havendoli io dimandato chi puÌ_ esser che habbi com'essa q'sta gran sceleragine di querelar tallamente sua Ecc.ze rispose queste formali parole. E stato un Christiano grande mescolato con li pigioli ; non volsi passar piÌ_ oltre; mÌÊ doppo alcuni giorni essendomi abocato con un tal Acmet Celebi, che Ì¬ il piÌ_ suiserato, et confidente amico, che habbi il detto Capichiagia, essendo presente anco il Dragoman Parada disse chiaramente il detto Acmet Celibi ÌÊ tutti doi noi, Che era stato l'Ambasc.r d'Inghiltera et Zorzi suo Dragomano , che havevano dato la denontia al Caimecan di Cost.li sopra quelle statue; In confirmatione di che con tal Ismail AgÌÊ , che era in Cost.li in tempo dell'assalto predeto disse a me chiaramente haver veduto con l'occhio proprio il giorno avanti andar all'udienza del Caimecan di Cost.li l'Ambasc.r di Inghiltera, poi partito per Villa la atina dietro segui l'assalto della Casa il detto Ismail Ì¬ Turco molto ben conosciuto dall'Ill.mo S.r Marc'Antonio Dolfino .

Sopra la mia conscienza ne piÌ_ ne meno et ita etq.a... same day Il Sr Michiel Parada Dragomano fatto venir et interrogato a dir in anima sua quello che hÌÊ potuto intendere nel negotio di quelle statue. rispose nei primi giori, che venne l'aviso dell'assalto dato alla asa della Ser.ma Rep.a in Pera il CapichiagiÌÊ del Caimecan di Cost.li mi disse chiaramente, che da Giauri fÌ_ data la denontia, et vi era u Ambass.r, mÌÊ che dirÌÊ tutto con un poco di tempo Doppo alcuni giorni il confidentissmo favorito di esso Capichiagia, che si chiama Acmet Celibi me disse, et replicÌ_ piÌ_ volte anco in altri giorni, che S.r Amb.r d'Inghiltera et Draperis hanno data la denontia al Caimecan, il quale Caimecan l'hÌÊ scrito al Capichiegia, et il Capichiagia ne hÌÊ data notitia al Caimecan d'Andrinopoli, et per non far romori con pericolo, che il Gran Sig.r venisse a saper qualche cosa, che sarebbe con grandi pericoli Ì¬ stato ordinato che non si parli, e si mostri di non saper che sia il querelante; mÌÊ in effetti una volta in presenza del Sanguinazo et altre volte con me solo il detto Acmet Celibi mi hÌÊ repplicato et confirmato questo, lodando, et esorbando sua Ecc.za ÌÊ disimular, et mostrar di non acorgersi con l'Ambasc.r d'Inghiltera, et con Draperis Anco Simon Armeno afferma con giuram.to et me lo hÌÊ detot piÌ_ volte, che in Casa di Domenico Piro alcuni giori prima, che succedesse l'assalto fu parlato di dette statue da esso Piron fratello del Dragoman Inglese consapevole di tutto quello, che si andava machinando. Questo Ì¬ quanto sÌ_ in anima mia, et ita et q.a same day Il S.r Ambroso Grillo Dragomano interrogato et avertito a dir la veritÌÊ sopra la sua conscienza sopra le cose antedete rispose come segue. Non mi raccordo il tempo preciso mÌÊ son'o piÌ_ di due mesi, che arrivÌ_ da Smirne al s.r Amb.r d'Inghiltera un mello che portÌ_ lettere a Sua Ecc.za, et a molti altri. Il giorno doppo improvisam.te si senti per la nostra Contrada un grandiss.mo sussuro, et mormoratione delli Dragomani Inglesi Draperis, et Piron , i quale essageravano, che fosse stato scritto a Venetia, et manda la da Sua Ecc.za all'Ecc.mo Senato fede so'tta dal Provintial di San Francesco. Dal Matelini Dall'Olivieri Da me, et da altri, che conteneva il sprezzo usato nella asa di Inghiltera, contro il Cadavere dell'Ecc.mo Proc.r Amb.r Capelo, come Cattolico pisciando sopra esso Cadavere posto sopra un luogo sporco; nello stesso tempo mettendosi le fas'de del F'ereze alla Centura quasi in atto di operare Ì¬ d'affatticarsi dicevano venga pur qui il Sr Gobato, che tutti noi saremo pronti in questo modo a protegerlo contro che si sia. Di Sua Ecc.za parlavano impropriam.te con dire, che haveva avelenato il Dragoman Laborda Francese, et un Gianizero con altri concetti pieni di mal'animo, et da questo tutti noi altri omprendesimo, che il messo da Smirne sopradetto havene portate lettere del Gobato; perche in quell'occ'ne medesima l'Hebreo Valentin, et altri molti ne hebbero di sue scritte tutte di mano prop.a che se le mostravano uno con l'altro/il contenuto d'esse non posso, ne devo affermare qual fosse perche non lo sÌ_ di certo; la veritÌÊ Ì¬ he in quei giorni non si sentivano altre voci, di Inglesi, et della Casa del S.r Ambasc.r d'Inghilt.a che Gobato Gobato, il quel si aspeta, et desidera ome le Hebrei il Messia. In tanto la Domenica Ì_ Lunedi matia, che ben non mim racordo andÌ_ il Sr Amb.r d'Inghiltera con Draperis all'audienza del Caimecan che li porrtÌ_ un presente di vesti; non posso dir le lonngamente li fosse trattenuto col detto Caimecan, perche non osservai piÌ_ che tanto, mai potendomi im'aginare una bestialitÌÊ cosi horende, che doppo si Ì¬ veduta. Tornato dall'udienza andÌ_ il S.r Ambascr pocco doppÌ_ in Villa nel giorno medesimo. La matina imediate sussequente si viddero piÌ_ di 600 persone alla Casa del Bailagio assaltandola con violenza metendovi guardie, bollando le amere impiegionando le Done che erano alla guardia cercavano anco gli huomeni, et la mia Casa medesima non andÌ_ essente da quel furore perche cercarono la Sig.ra mia madre, et me che si salvassimo alla meglio; furono tolte dalla Casa due figure ordinarie di huomo, et di don'a et portate al Caimecan essendo stata querelata Sua Ecc.za d'haver con quelle, et con le tre Done umputate per Streghe, et con Sacerdoti; et orat.ni contro Turchi procurata la morte del Gran Sig.re et della Sultana madre. Subito venni a darne l'aviso a Sua Ecc.za, et con l'agiuto di Dio si terminÌ_ in bene il negotio in Andrinopoli, di dove partito per far disbolar la Casa viddi, come mezi morti nella vÌ¬ra, et nelle parole il Draperis sopra tuttik, et altri dipendenti dalla Casa d'Inghiltera. Devo anco dire, che fui istantemente ricercato d'una fede, he il Cadavere sopradeto fosse stato ben trattato in Casa d'Inghiltera, come la fecero anco subito il Masselini, et il Provincial di S. Franesco, mÌÊ io non volsi farla senza ordine espresso di Sua Ecc.za, et arrivatomi esso ordine, subito la feci nel modo, che mi era stato ordinato Dimandato se si discorreva in Costantinopoli, chi havesse denontiata, e formentata quella querella, rispose. Io per le diligenze usate hÌ_ saputo dalli piÌ_ stretti Confidenti del Caimecan di Cost.li, frÌÊ quali vi Ì¬ un tale chiamato Vechil Car suo magg.r Domo , il qual mi disse, che un Drag.no Ì¬ stato causa di tutta queta rovina , mÌÊ volendo io penetrar piÌ_ oltre, mi disse, che tutti havevano prohibitione di parlare, e che per all'hora non poteva dirmi di piÌ_, e che tacessi. M'interrogÌ_ solamente, per qual causa li Franchi, et li Amb.ri si odiano cosÌÂ mortalmente, mÌ_ io rispossi, che il Sig.r Cac.r Grande mai hÌÊ odiato alcuno, anzi hÌÊ stiato, et honorato tutti. SÌ_ anco, che una schiava della Selvaga P'rona della Casa del Bailaggio havendo veduta tanta rovina piangendo, disse altramente, sia maledetto quel draperis. Il Draperis lo seppe, et si lamentÌ_, minaciando all'hora, ogn'uno trqi[? tacqi] si vidde anco nelli stetti momenti attaato alla sepoltura del Sig.r Rag.to Soncino un Cartello ingiurioso contro Sua Ecc.za, et il Prov: di S. Franc.o mi disse, che havendolo fatto levare, et osservato bene li Bollettini rossi, con quali stava attacato, hÌÊ conosciuto chiaro, ch'erano di quei med.mi, che lui face fare la sera avanti assai Carichi di coloro, e che FrÌÊ Paciffico di Gierusalem in quella sera med.ma andÌ_ ÌÊ pgliarne dalla Jeo [Ico?], che li fabricava, vedendosi pure dal Cartello, che adesso Ì¬ presso S. E., che quelli Bollini sono fatti molto di fretco[?], tanto piÌ_ che Ì¬ cosa chiara, e nota ad ogn'uno, che nÌ¬ in Costantinopoli, nÌ¬ in GalatÌÊ, nÌ¬ in Pera si fabricano da altri Hostie rosse, che dalli Padri di San Franco adoprandosi da per tutto, da ogn'uno la Cera spagna, et Hostia bianche. Interrogato rispose. Questo Padre Paciffico habita ella Casa med.a di Draperis, et Ì¬ Congiont.mo seco per diversi interessi, che hanno insieme, onde con questo rincontro, et osservatione del Prvinciale, e del Masselini, ogn'uno hÌÊ tenuto per fermo, che il negotio sia venuto da quella banda, nÌ¬ si puÌ_ creder diersamente. Venuto poi quÌÂ, hÌ_ udito voce di diersi, che accennavano sopra la Casa d'Inghilterra, mÌÊ io non hÌ_ detto, nÌ¬ procurato saper d'avantaggio, non tenendo apresso orde, e questo Ì¬ quanto sÌ_, oltre altre particolaritÌÊ, che credo haver espresse nelle lettere scritta ÌÊ S. E., et ita. Relectum confirmavit, et iuravit. Io Ambroso Grillo Drag.n off.o, quanto di sopra con mio giur.to, et aggiungo quello, che adesso mi soviene, ciÌ_Ì¬, che doppo desbollatta la Casa volendo le donne ritornar alla sua guardia, il Draperis havendo confidenza on una di essi, fece tutti li sforzi possibili per metterla in terrore, e persuaderla ÌÊ star insieme con le altre, lontantissima da quella Casa, perche li sarebbe succeduto qualche gran male; Il che sarebbe stato di grand.mo pregiud.o, perche poi haverebbe dato ad intendere al Caimecan, che sono fuggite, per esser Maghe. Sua Ecc.za perÌ_ hÌÊ remediato, perche le hÌÊ fatte trattener in ogni modo, e si trovano tuttavia nella Casa med.a, e cosÌÂ affermo di novo con mio giur.to. 1/15/1663 Ismail AgÌÊ SpaÌÂ venuto quÌÂ da Costantinopoli per suoi affari interrogato sopra il detto negotio in lingua Italiana da lui molto ben intesa, pratticando anco frequentemente nelle sette Torri con gl'Ill.mi Dolfino, e Molino amonito ÌÊ dir la veritÌÊ, risposa nella seguente forma. Io mi trovavo in GalatÌÊ, quando viddi passar li Cavalli del Sig.r Amb.r d'Ing.ra in Costantinopoli e poi lui med.mo con la sua Corte all'Udienza del Caimecan, et la mattina dietro essendo succedeto l'assalto della Casa della Ser.ma Rep.ca, conobbi chiaramente, che da lui veniva ogni male, sapendo, che Zorzi Draperis non puÌ_ sentir ÌÊ nominar li Ill.mi Venetiani. Del resto ch'Ì¬ seguito, non sÌ_ dar informate et itÌÊ et Relectum confirmavit, et iuravit. 5/16/1665 Delle benignissime di V're Ecc.ze di 4 Marzo devo accusar humilm.te la ricevuta. Circa il Gobato et il Giovane di lingua Piron non hÌ_, che aggiungere A questo facio soministrar de? ogni tre Mesi a conto delle sue paghe di Giovane di lingua; et se ben per hora l'hÌ_ acquietato al dovere; nondimeno al tempo di Pace non sofrirÌÊ certamento di trattenersi con questo solo caratere et senza quello di Dragomano nutrirÌÊ livori[?] perniciosiss.mi nel Cuore perche giÌÊ l'ettÌÊ sua, il talento la nascita lo rendono d'avantaggio capace. mÌÊ in questi tempi di Guerra il negotio Ì¬ assai geloso et come humilm.te scrissi all'Eccmo Senato conferirebbe molto il prometterli la carica a tempo proprio, mÌÊ senza effetuarla prima che arrivino le beneditioni della Pace; il che mi servirebbe di stimolo efficace per desiderar di conseguirla.

Il piÌ_ valido fondamento, che habbiano i Turchi in loro avantaggio nella decisione delli confini Ì¬ il Coggetto fatto ultimamente comparir alla luce dall'Archivio regio, benche non era per avanti ignoto alli confinanti inesti e molesti, ma per via di copie e fragmenti, in virtÌ_ del quale si perde la contesa giurisdittione di TraÌ_, nel resto quadra al proposito. In tutti li veduti essemplari Turcheschi, et in piÌ_ 612v Tradottioni io non trovo, che altri CadÌÂ di ordine regio fossero deputati alla revisione delli confini, se non il CadÌÂ del Serraglio della Bossina, et li CadÌÂ hora di Clissa, et hora di Clivina[?], tuttavia il detto Coggetto Ì¬ autenticato in secondo ordine dal CadÌÂ di Scardon Ecco un' obiettione, et un sospetto, che li CadÌÂ di Clissa et Clivina non s'habbino voluto ingerire in cosa che havesse contradittione, et perÌ_ si puÌ_ stare che mostrino Coggetto autenticato da legitimi deputati.

Anco il Comand.to del Gran Sre ordena che si vadi sopra loco, e si mettano i segnali; hora ÌÊ voler mostrarsi, che TraÌ_ fosse stato revisto, bisognarebbe, che i Turchi mostrassero i segnali di croci, Ì_ altro in arbori, e pietre, et in masiene, 613v come s'Ì¬ pratticato ÌÊ descriver, e limitar gli altri contadi; potrebbono opponersi i Turchi, che col processo del tempo fossero stati levati, ma non oppositione, che appaghi l'intelletto, mentre la vigilanza loro Ì¬ stata sempre in sommo grado, piÌ_ tosto in avanzarsi, che ÌÊ star saldi sÌ_ le mete, massime non esser cosÌÂ facile, che si levi una numerositÌÊ di segnali, che non vi appara alcun vestigio. Si contiene di piÌ_ nel citato Comand.to per la revision delli confini, ch'essendo passati alcuni castelli, fortezze, sotto il comando Ottomano nella guerra, et altre restate in possesso Veneto, debbano i periti dichiarir e assegnar i loro antichi termini.

Non hÌÊ dubbio alcno, che in toto rigore legis sta'do per essersi fatto l'assalimento senza p'neria intimatione contra la fede data, non ostanti giuramenti negativi, verrebbe esser illegitimo l'imputa, e non giuridico il possesso.

Cosi fanno i Polachi, i quali inviano il loro Generale con quaranta milla soldati alle confinanti rive del Nistro, donde si espedisce internontio con lettere interpellati nelle differrentie vertenti, se si vuol 3v pace, Ì_ guerra, ad utraq' parati dichiarandosi, e poi compar l'Ambascatore. Adonq' co barbari se ius in armis consiste, la spada Ì¬ quella, che deve sciolgere questo nodo Gordiano. Sin che vissero coloro, che s'attrovarono nell' horribil rotta da Turchi havuta nella giornata navale, s'hebbe pace quieta et amistÌÊ perfetta, ma morti[?] quelli, historici occulati del sanguinaso conflitto, s'Ì¬ persa la memoria del valore pregio x'piano. Certo Ì¬ che il turco Ì¬ piÌ_ che un' idra di sette teste in copia di militie stipendiarie, e feudatarie, ÌÊ segno che se si confligge e rompe una squadra, piÌ_ ne sormontano, e per quanti morano nei conflitti, altrittanti ne pullulano bramosi dei luoghi vacanti. Veramente 4 in campo avorto[? accerto?] Ì¬ invincibile nelle moltiplicci rimeste, che perÌ_ in sito ava'tagioso gli fÌÊ resistenza, lo rintuzza competentemente. Cosi fecero i Polachi contra sultan Osman, passati il fiume Nistro, e trincieratisi nella Moldavia, in guisa che non valendo l'armi Turchesche, si viene ÌÊ parlamenti in rimotion degl' infesti Cosacchi. L'istesso incisca intravenne ÌÊ suo fr'ello Sultan Murat, che concitato contra Polachi cavalcÌ_ sino i Andrenopoli, ove di belligero fossi[?] pacifico nel sentore, che Polachi erano prontissimi alla battaglia, iscusatasi la manchiata per sinistro conseglio. Con puri coragio si diportarono i Transilvani ultimamente, al passo dei loro 4v monti assalendo li BassÌÊ di Buda, Rossina, e Temistuar, tesi ÌÊ conculcar quella provintia in remessa di Prencipe dependente, partititi con ignominiosa strage, si che per colorir il temerario tentativo, fÌ_ dalla Porta proveduto contra gli aggressori. Di simil openione in fatti Ì¬ il Matthei Prencipe di Valacchia, havuto per contumace, et intestino ribelle, et pur Ì¬ simulato nel dubbio d'havere la peggio nella ferma deliberation di cimentar l'armi, incessabilmente preparate, se si decreta in sua dismission da quel Prencipato. Intrepidi in ciÌ_ superano qual si voglia li Albanesi montani, mica Casciatisi[?] soggiongare, non men fortificati nell'alpestri[?] balze, che fidati nelle robuste braccie. ÌÛ costoro uniformi, e conformi sono 5 i Mainotti, di natione, et animositÌÊ Lacedemoni novelli. Negli anni ÌÊ drietro non furono i Turchi bastanti ÌÊ ricuperar da Moscoviti la Tana in ripetite speditioni, rihavuta solo per interpositione di Lupulo Prencipe di Moldavia, estortando li Moscoviti alla restitutione di'una fortezza particolare, per non haver una guerra generale. Dalla terra seguentemente scendiamo in mare, e laviando ÌÊ parte il terrore, che nei tempi passati recavano gli Uscochi alli confinanti turchi colla Dalmatia, trovaremo, che i Cosacchi colle sue Saiche, Ì_ barche armate s'han fatto timor alle galee Turchesche tutte et ÌÊ scorno loro son trapassate sin ai liti[?] suburbani del tratto di Costantinopoli, 5v depredando e saccheggiando arditamente, e pur son privati masnudieri[?], Ì_ pirati. Ben si cava, che in parte talhora si trova ostacolo ÌÊ Turchi, i quali via piÌ_ fanti vigorosi, quando intendono la discordia trÌÊ X'piani, come al p'nte trovano ÌÊ suo favor le discordi congionture. Et ottimamente sanno per esperienza in propria causa, che declinano le forze nella discussione, et Ì¬ fresco in loro l'essempio della famosa ribellione di Zampolut, signor di nascita, e d'antichitÌÊ giÌÊ cospicua trÌÊ nobil Arabi della Soria, il quale sotto Sultan Acmed, padre del Regnante, fÌ_ di tanto concetto, che per debillarlo corsero in Asia tutte le militie dell' Europa, applicate per parecchi anni alle guerre d'Ungaria nella 6 pretensione di valori l'annual tributo di tentar milla zecchini dall' Imperator Rudolfo, da Massimilian per necessitÌÊ pagato piÌ_ fiate. E mai gl' Imperiali non haverebbero conseguito apertura di pace, se li ribelli Asiatici non havessero distolto gli Ottomani da quelle battaglie, e pretensioni. Non cadono due cose in consideratione per contrapesar la potenza del Tuco, Ì_ diversione, Ì_ invasione. La prima cioÌ¬ la diversione si potrebbe fare, se spalleggiati i Mainotti per mare, volessero uscir dalli sui inaccessibil asili ÌÊ perturbar e danneggiar la Morea, quella parte appunto, dove s'aspettano le paranzane per Canea. L'istesso si potria procurar colli 6v Cimeriotti gli antichi epirotti sopra la Valona. Lascio l'aspettative de Cosacchi, e Moscoviti, le lontananze de quali non apportano benefitio opportuno, se non continge'te. Oltre che coll' obligo della deime giovarebbe ÌÊ conceder corso de' ventuniesi, che con fregatoni armati potrebbero penetrar nei fiumi prencipali in facile prede d'animali, scorsendo altri con navilij poderosi il mare in busca di vasselli, et ÌÊ bostinar nell' isole dell' Arcipelago, e le riviere della Gretia, e Natolia, salve riservati i Greci, per haverli concorrenti e consentienti almen per guide contro gl' inimici Turchi, i quali si fattamente infestati sarebbero becessitati di guardar 7 le marine, restando di confluir alla volta della Dalmatia. La seconda poi, ch'Ì¬ l'invasione, nella volontÌÊ consiste, mentre la possibilitÌÊ Ì¬ sufficiente, atteso che se i Turchi sapessero d'haver non la superioritÌÊ, ma l'egualitÌÊ, cercando andriano in ogni luogo l'Armata Veneta, riputata migliore in bontÌÊ di segni, artiglierie, marinari, vogadori, e bombardieri. Che cosa han fatto i Turchi con eccesso di provisioni? all' improviso han assaltato la Canea, non espugnata anco, ma resasi piÌ_ per lo deplorato soccorso, che per li spessi assalti. Cadeva poi essa piazza, se traversato era il passaggio d'alqua'te galee, rischiatesi d'inverno nel rigor d'ordeni Regij in suo sovegno di vettovaglie, e combattimenti, d'entrambo per mancanza et 7v inermita di bisognosa. ÌÛ talche s'Ì¬ antenuta per mez' anno, sin che il grosso dell' Armata nemica ÌÊ vele piene approdÌ_ quest' estate ÌÊ quelle spiaggie, con isbarco di sessanta milla huomeni, e discarico non men di monitioni abbondanti, che di cannoni amisurati, ÌÊ viva forza condotti dalla Caucus ÌÊ batter il porto della Suda[?], ripetendo il viaggio in secondo soccorso con circa trenta galee. Alzo sin'hora questo secondo anno in quelle punti non hanno fatti i Turchi con isforzo totale, e se in Dalmatia pasero Novigradi, vinsero piÌ_ per malitia, che per arte militare con grad' essercito contra picciol propugnacolo, se ben effettivamente Novigradi in elevato sito dominando mar ingolfatto, monte boschivo, ch'Ì¬ la Morlaca, il fiume 8 d'Obrovazzo della dition turca, e parte del contado Zaratino, Ì¬ castello di considerabil consequenze* [in margin: * scala di sali e Segne], senza li quali rispetti conferirebbe maggiormente l'avanzato nel territorio di Macarsca, anch' ella scala. Dall' altra Ì¬ converso l'Armata Turchescha non Ì¬ stata bastevole ÌÊ resister alla cannonate di galeoni Veneti, comparsi in faccia delle piÌ_ celebri fortezze Turche, e se durava ancora una settimana quella formidabil comparsa, intendesi, che succedeva sollevation di popolo. L'anno passato, come appar dal presentato mio ragionamento maritimo, la quantitÌÊ delle galee e Saiche superava il numero delle comparse l'anno presente, in summa di ottanta galee sottili, sei frÌÊ bastarde e grosse, ducento Saiche 8v e XX bertoni, questi accrescuti, nel resto decadono e le galee, e le Saiche. Se sole cinquanta galee si son partite dalla Canea, il restante dell' Armata predetta non per altro si deve pensar, che dimori ivi, se non per traghettar l'invernata quanto bisogna dalla Morea, e dalle rive circonvicine, quando non habbino intentione ad alcun assalto, che l'occasion comportasse. ÌÛ tali traghettamenti fÌÊ di mestieri invigilar, e spiar di coglier l'inimico ÌÊ mal grado delli dimoranti nell' usurpato, avertendo d'haver anco l'occhio ÌÊ Rodi, accioche da quella banda non seguano uscite improvise, et ÌÊ Milo varco per linea retta alla Canea. Appresso ÌÊ quanto s'Ì¬ accennuto spettar alla 9 alla vigilanza delle ose maritime, per contravenir ÌÊ gli andamenti nemii con iscopo d'haver certa la Canea in vigilato et non intermesso assedio; non saria medianti buone scorte difficil una sorpresa ÌÊ Sio, se ben impossibil il lungo mantenimento nella mancanza del vitto, da terra ferma giornalmente corrisposo, et ogni possesso, Ì_ nolumento di quell' isola tocarebbe al iusso[?] ÌÊ piÌ_ comandanti maritimi, ivi opoluntem.te accasati, procurando almeno d'incendiar le galee lÌÊ disarmate, Ì_ riconerate. finalmente quando non sia grossa guardia appostata di galee ÌÊ Sio, se lÌÂ non riesce profittevol l'offesa, interclusi colle custodie di vasselli volteggianti li accennati transiti alla Canea, he in moltitudine di genti hÌÊ bisogno di spessi soccorsi, in che del continuo studia gl' inimici, verso i prencipij della primavera preoccupando l'essito nemico, 9v ben provisti e muniti spinger si posson di nuovo armati legni in faccia delli Dardanelli colli ripieghi migliori, che la prattia puÌ_ haver somministrato ÌÊ piÌ_ proficui successi, tanto ostando all' uscita, quanto all' introito, per l'una riprimendo l'inimico ingiuriosamente sequestrato, per l'altro interdicendo il commodo di conducibil vettovaglie et appestamenti[?] dal Mar Egeo, dominando col Cannone, corso, e sbarco secondo che dettirÌÊ la peritia unita su'l fatto alla prudenza. In quest' ardita guisa mentre altro non seguisse nella mortification de gl' inimici in sussurri populani, e mutinamenti populari ÌÊ non potervi spuntare, si malediran i contsultori, si detesteran li spergiusi[?], si biasmeran li capriccij, tanto piÌ_ rendendosi essosa la guerra, quanto di prede e spoglie, priva, e giust' al detto di Giustiniani Imperatore 10 in armorum stepita omnia iura silibunt, e parleran le glose in favor della ragione ÌÊ temperamento, e contro della severitÌÊ delle leggi accennate. In modo che allhora troveransi le chiavi nella fucina della necessitÌÊ battute, che apriran le chiuse porte del tempio della pace, et haveransi in trattato di ragionevolezza pacifiche conventioni, sempre sottentabili francamente con honorevolezza. Altrimente uscendo Ì_ trapassando l'inimico, potrebbe ripetere reitirar li viaggi e passaggi al' Ariadeno Barbarossa, assai noti nell' historie* [in margin: *sin ÌÊ Castel novo nelle bocche di Cattaro], massime che il terzo anno supponer si deve, che habbino ad uscir i turchi e piÌ_ prattici, e piÌ_ fozuti[?]. Et cosi molto travagliosa riusciria la necessaria conservation del Regno di Candia, non men antemurale del Dominio Veneto, che Bastione della Rep.ca X'piana, 10v il cui decoro quando pur[?] fatali sciagure cessasse, pronte sarebbero le invidiose e malevoli nation estere ad appaltar p[er] se stesse li ogli moscati, miele, e sacchi di limone condiversion di traffichi, e iattura de' datij, otre che abietto il rispetto, s'aspirarebbe ad altro con altri anco Potentati, eccitandosi li Candiotti Greci contro Franchi.

QuÌÂ VechiascÌ¬ disse, Ì_ Messagger d‰ÛªIddio, quando io ricevei la botta, ero spogliato, perÌ_ spogliati anco tÌ_, p[er] il che trahendo di dotto le sue vesti, si riempiva l‰Ûªaria di ringulti[?] e clamorrissato adunq[ue] nudo gli homeni il gran Profeta, VechiascÌ¬, che voleva veder il sigillo Profetico sÌ_ quelle delicate carni impresso, di subito gli tolse dalle mani la sforza, esplicandosi, che due erano gli scopi della sua tenzone [trezone?], uno di far costar al mondo la sua eguitÌÊ, e l‰Ûªaltra di baciar nuda la sua vita, della 226v qual disse il Nontio d‰ÛªIddio, che chi la toccÌ_ in questo mondo, non sentirÌÊ le fiamme dell‰Ûªinferno nell‰Ûªaltro. Dopo che ritornato dalla Moschea il Profeta ÌÊ casa nell‰Ûªaugumento della sua indispositione, in tempo che lo spinto suo nobilissimo ambiva di far passaggio dalla mondana pregione alla celeste patria, gli comparse l‰ÛªAngelo Gabriele, che gli ragionÌ_ in questa guisa: ÌÕ Divin Profeta, Il Creator dell‰ÛªUniverso ti saluta, e messe in suo libero arbitrio la morte, et la vita: se vuoi la vita, ti sia concessa, e se vuoi morire, morirei senza travaglio nesuno. Rispose egli, Ì_ Gabriele, la volontÌÊ mia si muove sol secondo il beneplacito dell‰Ûªaltissimo Iddio, ÌÊ cui con buona credenza mi son raccommandato. In questo mentre ordinÌ_ ad Ebubechir, che guidasse il popolo, come per ubidienza fece, havendolo guidato alla moschea, dove condottosi al luogo solito del Profeta, quei muri gli rappresentarono la sua sacra faccia 227r et commossero ÌÊ pianger lui, et tutta la congregatione, che con le sue flebili voci interrotte ferÌÂ[?] gli orecchi del Profeta, il q[ua]le intendendo da FatimÌ¬, che il Popolo si accorava per la sua partenza, si sforzÌ_ di venir fuori ÌÊ consolarlo. Poi AlÌÂ gli disse, Ì_ Nontio d‰ÛªIddio, io hÌ_ veduto in sogno, che havevo indosso un sacco, che mi fÌ_ anco levato: Ei cosÌÂ interpretÌ_ l‰Ûªinsogno; quell‰Ûª armatura vuol inferir mÌ¬, che da tutti gli insulti t‰ÛªhÌ_ sempre difeso, verrÌÊ tempo, che senza me sarai molto combattuto et afflitto, tuttavia non ti conturbar, ma stÌÊ sempre cosonante e costantemente sopporta. Indi FatimÌ¬ piangente disse Ì_ Nontio Divino. Jo nel mio sogno hÌ_ veduto, che tenevo un foglio di carta in mano, che all‰Ûªimproviso mi Ì¬ stato levato: Quel foglio, parlÌ_ il Profeta, son io, che sparirÌ_ da gli occhi tuoi. Poi Chassan, e Chussein dissero, Ì_ felice nostr‰Ûª Avo; noi anco in sogno habbiamo 227v veduto una lettica p[er] aria, sotto la qual noi caminavamo col capo scoperto. ÌÕ amatissime parti del cuor mio, quella lettica Ì¬ il mio cabiletto, sotto cui, voi haverete ÌÊ grie [gire?]. Date queste interpretationi, gli venne[?] poscia un giorno l‰ÛªAngelo Gabriele, e gli parlÌ_, ammonendolo che stava alla porta sua felice l‰ÛªAngelo della morte, il quale chiedeva licenza d‰Ûªentrare, se ben mai la dimandÌ_ ÌÊ nessun‰Ûª huomo. Egli si contentÌ_ subito ch‰Ûªentrasse in camera, ove quegli il salutÌ_ riverentemente, dicendogli, Iddio m‰ÛªhÌÊ spedito ÌÊ te, perÌ_ che habbi riguardo alla tua contentezza: se mi vien da te permesso, torrÌ_ l‰Ûªanima tua, e la trasporterÌ_ in Paradiso, se non mi ritornerÌ_ al mio adorato Creatore. Il Profeta si voltÌ_ verso Gabriele, il qual gli disse, Ì_ Eccellentia della creature, l‰Ûªaltissimo Iddio Ì¬ desideroso della tua bellezza lassÌ_, et tutti li profetti sono cupidi delle tua 228r P[er]sona. Il Profeta cosi rispose alll‰ÛªAngelo della morte, la spada della tua terribilita Ì¬ il coltello dello stame di nostra vita. Non dimorar piÌ_ ÌÊ far l‰Ûªuffitio tuo, poscia che anch‰Ûª io tramo di veder quelle magior ensne[?].

Dopo molte importune istanze, ne diede FatimÌ¬ conto al Profeta, che le disse, sai Ì_ FatimÌ¬ chi sia quell‰ÛªArabo tanto sollecito? FatimÌ¬ rispose, Iddio il sÌÊ. Et il suo Profeta. Allhora ei le rivelÌ_, che 228v Quell‰ÛªArabo Ì¬ il troncator de i gusti, il separator delle compagnie, l‰ÛªAngelo della morte, il q[u]ale Ì¬ venuto ÌÊ tor lo spirito mio, et ad esso non Ì¬ chiusa porta veruna, se ben ÌÊ me, come ÌÊ Profeta hÌÊ mostrato termini di humiltÌÊ. ÌÛ che piangendo e lagrimando FatimÌ¬, il Profeta p[er] sua consolatione le insegnÌ_, che dovesse ripetir piÌ_ fiate questa notitia [patientia?]: tutti noi siamo nati p[er] Dio, et ad esso habbiamo ÌÊ ritornare. Al fia entrÌ_ nella forma d‰ÛªArabo l‰ÛªAngelo della morte, e cosÌÂ espose, salve Ì_ gran Profeta, Iddio si saluta, et mi hÌÊ commandato, che venga ÌÊ tor lo spirito tuo: hor tÌ_ che comandi? Il Profeta risposegli, desidero da te che aspetti fia che venga mio fr[at]ello l‰ÛªAngelo Gabriele. Sia fatto soggionse l‰ÛªAngelo della morte, il tuo comandamento. FrÌÊ tanto da parte d‰ÛªIddio fÌ_ ordinato, che si adornassero i paggi, e le Dive del Cielo, che li demonij infernali fermasero quel fuogo, 229r e nascondessero quei mostri, e che i cori de‰Ûª beati, e le Gerarchie de gli Angioli fossero preparati ad incontrar con celesti lumi l‰Ûªanima di Mehemmet. Adempite che hebbe tutte queste commissioni Gabriele, apparve ÌÊ Mehemmet, il qual gli disse, Ì_ fr[at]ello p[er] q[ua]l cagione in questo stato m‰Ûªabbandoni? Gabriel gli rispose, sono stato sin‰Ûª hora applicato in tuo servitio, havendogli raccontato il prenarrato preparo. Il Profeta disse questi annontij son buoni, ma ne vorria di migliori.

Sit par obedientibus prefettis Dei. Le due lettere sono la Patente aperta che accompagna Dupier, et la lettera del Sig.r di Liona giÌÊ mandata all'Ecc.mo Senato. 3/30/1665 Ìö apitato per le mani del S.r Padre una epistola tradotta, della quale con bel modo se nÌ¬ Ì¬ fatta copia, et quella subito consignata et qa Essendo V'ra Ecc.za tanto lontana, io non posso rappresentar lo[?] passato, et questo servirÌÊ per quanto per hora il s.r Padre, et io habbiamo in adempim.to, et essecutione deli commandam.ti di V'ra Eccza, alla quale et c.a Pera 30 Marzo 1665 4/11/1665 Humiliss.mo Rev.mo q.te T.

Il mi fÌÊ pervenire con riserve, et cautelle, et con parole misteriose. GiÌÊ il Molte Ill.re Sig.r Fornetti prudentissmo, et da me stimatissimo Dragomano della MaestÌÊ Cristianiss.ma , et buon servo dell'Ecc.ma Casa dellHaije; quando capitÌ_ qui da Belgrado mi fecce il favore di consolarmi con la sua visita, et con l'aviso felice d'esser stato honorevolmente spedito dall'Ecc.mo Primo Visir con aperte dichiarationi, che sarÌÊ ricevuto dall'Eccelsa Porta, et honorato, come conviene a grand' Amb.re l'Ecc.mo S.r di Vantelet mio supremo Sig.re, al quale, et all'Ecc.mo suo Padre professa la Ser.ma Repca con sinceritÌÊ di Cuore una stima aggiustata alle virtÌ_, Ì¬ meriti di quella nobiliss.a Casa; et mentre il Mondo hÌÊ osservato sempre le mie fervide brame delle magg.ti prosperitÌÊ et essaltatione dell'Ecc.ze loro; poco Ì_ niente devo travagliarmi, se qualche persona non ben intentionata si preparasse a proferir concetti contrarij con speranze di meritare come on piÌ_ d'uno fÌ_ giÌÊ acutamente tentato. Haverei creduto, che il potese co caratteri aperti rallegrarsi meco della vicina venuta di qel Cav.re non mandarmi occultamente per terza mano copia dell risposta dell'Ecc.mo Primo Visir o titoli di epistole che dall'istessi Turchi son'o publicate, e troppo feriscono la mia sinceritÌÊ. Voglio credere, che il[?] per le sue indispositioni possi haver tralasciate le parti della puntualitÌÊ dovuta el riverir licenti dell'Ecc.mo S.r di Vantelet, et nel ricooscer me stesso antico suo suiseratiss.mo servo; perciÌ_ la ompatisco, desiderandole dal S.r Dio salute, et prosperitÌÊ. Andrinopoli XI Aprile 1665. [undated, cut in middle] Arrivato in Cost.li il Dragomano Fornetti si trovÌ_ pocche hore doppo col Dragomano Cristoforo Tarsia il quale havendo saputo, che questa sua secretiss.a prattica era stata scoperta come humilm.te scrissi sotto li 6 febraro; mostrÌ_ di paletare volontariam.te quel, che era giÌÊ notto; cioÌ¬,che Dopier, et Fornetti fossero andati in sua Casa ÌÊ consultare, mÌÊ tacque il punto d'haver formata la scrittura, Ì_ lettera presentata al Visir; perche non si Ì¬ notto, che io habbi ciÌ_ penetrato, ne sÌÊ, che io tengo presso di me quella, ch'Ì¬ di suo proprio pugno, liquidato il Carattere con giuramento dal Dragomano Brutti suo stretto parente, et dal Musli Scrivano Turco , che di grand' Anni lo onosco, Ì¬ prattica seco, che pur in scritt'a hÌÊ giurato il medesimo, come potrano far molti altri, che lo conocono, ne ciÌ_ puÌ_ cader in dubbio; Credendosi dunque dal Tarsia, che siano incognite a me q'ste sue prime fontioni hÌÊ stimato sop[er]ir tutte le gelosie Ì¬ sospetti, co'l farmi arrivare sotto obligo di secreteza una forma di risposta copiata da Tomaso suo figlio, del quale hÌ_ liquidato il Carattere, che pare[?] fatta dal Visir al S.r di Liona. Quella, come l'Ecc.ze V're resterasi servite osservare quasi incontra nella sostanza coll'altra, di cui mando all'Ecc.mo Sen.o la tradutione havuta ol ezo del Scrivano del Reis Effendi , mÌÊ oltre qualche alteratione nelle parole et concetti, che potranno osservarsi vi Ì¬ un agiunta interlineata nella ZiffrÌÊ, che mi hÌÊ accresciuta la comotione dell'animo; perche certamente Ì¬ fatta con artificio et concerto co Fornetti; il quale vÌÊ da per tutto divulgando per sottentar le grandezze della Franza, che il suo RÌ¬ hÌÊ scritto al Visir di voler per sÌ¬ i luoghi di Barbaria, cosa falsiss.ma perche le copie delle stesse lettere capitatemÌ¬ all'hora, rubate al Tarsia di suo pugno stesso incontrate con altre,che cavai qui, Ì¬ con le tradutione delli Dragomani Grillo, et Brutti, che uno non sapeva dell'altro niente assolutamente parlatto, Ì_ mottivano sopra quella materia molto ancora ne persuade la ragione, che mentro io RÌ¬ desidera mandar qui un suo Ambasc.r volesse nella stessa sua lettera protestar nove[?] rottare; anzi dichiarare di pretendere possesso dei luoghi di Barbaria. Confesso humilm.te, che questa putrida inventione et agiunta fatta certamente dal Tarsia, che mi manda la copia di sua propria mao mi hÌÊ grand.to aggitato, perche scopro con chiare evidenze mirarsi unicamente da lui ad' inganare con mendaci per compiacere a Francesi, Ì¬ mostrar d'altro canto di farmi pervenir[?] questa scrittura con segni di gran timore, che possa esser penetrata; mentre nella prima scritta da Liona al Visir niuna mentione mi fecce; perche repplico si crede da lui che io non la sappi. Queste dopie procedure degne di som'o rifflesso mi rendono ben avertito a caminar cauto, Ì¬ prevedere senza difficultÌÊ secreto conventicule perniciosi discorsi, lumi tenebrosi che darÌÊ il Tarsia al s.r di Vartelet subito arrivato con unico oggetto d'altamente meritar secco, Ì¬ profitarsi in occulto con dano dell'Ecc.ze Vostre GiÌÊ tutto Ì¬ liquidato le scritture Turche, et Italiane con ricognitione de Caratteri son'o presso di me con le fedi sopra accennate, et perche non dubito, che quello novo tratto artifitioso usato meco dal Tarsia non sia stato rappresentato al S.r dell'Haye, et al figlio co li stessa almen di Fornetti, et queste forme nascoste molto servoo ad' accrescer la diffidenze verso la persona mia, et li rischi alla publica causa hÌ_ rissolto risponder al Tarsia, quanto V're Eccze si compiaceran vedere dall'occlusa copia per chiuderli la bocca, ribater ogni sua sinistra informatione, et io in caso di bisogno mi valerÌ_ della stessa mia lettera, co'l Sr di Vantelet per evidente rimostranza della pub.a dispositione, et della mia devotione verso quella Casa. Non posso negare, che il Fornetti non habbi usata meco magg.r sinceritÌÊ, che un Dragomano dell'Eccc.ze Vostre tanto beneficiato anco di recente et se il Tarsia non li havesse suggerita qualche ombra sarebbe il Fornetti medesimo passato meco ÌÊ piÌ_ confidenti, et veraci communicationi. perche dall'effetto si vede, che non hebbe ardire parlando meco; quando si trovÌ_ qui di dirmi q'sta gra bugia, che il S.r Di Liona havesse intimato al Visir di volersi impatronir della Barbaria; Ì¬ ben vero, che vÌÊ milantando questi concetti in luoghi ordinarij [mss ends here] 12/9/1665 Di 18, et 22 Agosto son'o due lettere di cotesto Ecc.mo Mag.to, da e ricevute con profonda humiltÌÊ. Circa il Dragomano Tarsia non hÌ_ che dire sin hora perche doppo il mio arrivo tratta con magg.r rispetto, et timore. Al Grillo hÌ_ levato di mano il negotio per giusti rispetti di sua pocca sinceritÌÊ; stÌ_ osservandolo, et occorendo prender proprie rivolutioni col beneplacito dell'Eccze v're. Per l'estintione del Dragoman Pace , vedo esser stato prevenuto dall'Eccmo Cav.r Amb.r Cornaro in Vienna ; cosi corrono le voci; mÌÊ se ciÌ_ non fosse, et colui capitasse qui, desiderosi com'andi dell'Ecc.ze V're. Veramente da queste ordine hÌÊ ricevuto il publico scarsi vantaggi ben notti ancora all'Ecc.mo S.r Bailo Cav.r Soranzo ; la prava natura d'alcuni di loro apporta ben spesso molti disturbi; parmi haverli rimessi per la magg.r parte in qualche obbidienza, mÌÊ non sÌ_ se basti.

In cinque anni, che io servo, hebbero compresi li stipendiati reali vinticinque mille trecento, come da conti giÌÊ trasmessi in Publico e i 50 vesti con ogni miglior trattam.to anco nel resto Mi hanno confidato li sopradetti, che nel primo congresso fÌ_ dato ÌÊ tutti sopra un imagine della Beata Vergine greca solene giuram.to di fedeltÌÊ, et unione reciproca inseparabile con stretto obligo di aiutarsi, et di star, cosi al bene, come al male.

Che se alcuno fosse ripreso, debbano esser tutti uniti alla sua diffesa. Che ogni minima parola che fosse detta secrettam.te ad' uno, sia sotto debito di giuram.to rifferita alli altri.

Perche non possa esser deta mai p[er] alcuna cosa in pregiuditio della mia riputat.ne, et p[er]che si sappi la sinceritÌÊ, con la q'le hÌ_ servito, e servirÌ_ al Ser.mo Pn'pe devo dire, che quando il S.r Dragoman Tarsia mi diede q'lla scritt'a secretta in greca da sottoscrivere, e mi stimolava ÌÊ farlo subito, io messi qualche difficoltÌÊ, dicendo, che voleva prima vedere se vi Ì¬ qualche cosa di pregiud.o pub.co, all'hora lui alterato rispose le seguenti parole. Se non potremo trovar altro conto chi non vorÌÊ sottoscrivere q'sta scritt'a d'esser insieme uniti, e di non rivelarla ad'alcuno potrÌ_ far intender al Bostangi Bassi, che sia passato p[er] le mani di q'sto tale, che non vorÌÊ sottoscrivere 20, Ì_ 30 mile Cechini p[er] contaminar li turchi ÌÊ favor de Segri Venetiani, e del S.r Ballarino, e basterÌÊ q'ste esempio ÌÊ farlo esterminare.

Hanno promesso di simulare, mÌÊ dubito, che proromperanno p[er] che sono tropo pieni d'amarezza, stimando, che il Tarsia con mal'Arti habbi tentato far cader tutti loro nella publica disgratia.

Per quello riguarda l'altra scritt'a in copia essendo l'originale presso di me formata di pugno, et sottoscritta dal solo Tarsia, nella quale esagera li strapazzi, e violenze usate da me alli Dragomani, non doverei estendermi in giustificat.ne p[er]che si tratta di causa propria, ma rimetter il giud.o ÌÊ Dio, et alla matura sapienza di V. Ser.tÌÊ; non di meno spero, che mi sarÌÊ lecito dir hum.te, che tutti ÌÊ para con bened.ni, con patim.ti, e fedel servitÌ_ han procurato sostenere il lor debito p[er] cinque anni. Il Tarsia piÌ_ de gl'altri mi si dichiarÌ_ obligato della stessa vita, et m'hebbe grand'occasione; p[er]che in riguardo alla sua povertÌÊ le feci esborsar da principio, che vi era com'ado di den.o, reali 1572 in un colpo p[er] saldo di suoi vechi crediti.

Mi hÌÊ dimandata con segretezza una lettera di cambio di 1200 Reali p[er] pagar un suo debito glelo hÌ_ concesso. Altre cose hÌ_ fatto, che non devo ridir[?], et che davano ÌÊ lui giusta occasione di conferrar ad'altra voce insolite beneficenze, ma il Vassello Inglese venuto di costÌÊ, che portÌ_ lettera di 15 Aprile con aviso sicuro trÌÊ gl'altri, che mi fossero venute abondantiss.me rimesse da V.

Accordingly: If there is any attack from the vilayet of Viyana, where Bergama is the border, Venetian begs should prevent it, if they cost any damage, Venetian begs should punish them The Venetian kadirgas and other kÌ_Ì¤Ì_k gemiler (small ships) that are coming to Istanbul, Galata, Arabistanda Iskenderiye and M€±s€±r, and bogazlar under Gelibolu can only enter with icazet (permission), unless they are hiding from a furtuna (storm) or pirate attacks.

If harami or levend gemis attack Venetians, and if Venetians fight back and caught them. They should not kill them but send it to the Sublime Porte. If my navy goes to a war, Venetian navy should not accept my enemies inside their navy.  They should not accept my enemies to their islands or castles, and if they catch their kumandans they should vanquish/punish (hakk€±ndan gelmek) them. If a Venetian comes to deal with trade in my land, his goods should be weighted with my scale and the money should be paid to him in full. They can send anyone they want as bailo.

If a Venetian ship sunk and people and their belongings survive. They should be liberated and their belongings should be returned to them. If a conflict raises related to a Venetian the case should be seen in the Sublime Porte. If I am away for a campaign bailo bring the case to the ‰Û÷Istanbul muhafazasi iÌ¤Ì_n konulan hakim‰Û Whenever there is litigation against a Venetian bazirgan or other Venetians the translator should be ready at the court. If there is no translator the kadi should not hear the case. They (Venetians) should not cause any difficulty by saying that the translator is not ready. If the translator is busy then the suspect should be taken into custody. Nobody should hassled bailos for their dept. It is known that some people refuse non-Muslim witnesses in their litigation against Venetians. Non-muslims witness should be accepted. If a Venetian merchant dies in Ottoman lands betyÌ_lmalc€± should not interfere with his inheritance. It should be handled by the bailos.
